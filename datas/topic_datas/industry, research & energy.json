It stressed the need for structured support mechanisms, innovation funding, and infrastructure investments—including smart grids and cross-border projects—to integrate renewables into energy markets, while emphasizing decentralized production to leverage local resources and enhance regional cohesion. The resolution highlighted unfair trade practices by emerging economies, advocating WTO dispute mechanisms and trade defense tools to protect EU industries, alongside strict sustainability criteria for imported bioenergy and agrofuels, including indirect land-use impacts. It called for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies by 2020, redirecting funds to clean technologies, and leveraging Horizon 2020 and Structural Funds (2014-2020) for R&D, energy storage, and SME support. Concerns included risks of deindustrialization, retroactive policy changes, and the need for stable regulatory frameworks to attract private investment. The Parliament emphasized regional cooperation, smart cities, and rural renewable projects to address energy poverty, while balancing agricultural renewable production with food security and biodiversity. It urged binding post-2020 targets, grid modernization, and streamlined permitting to achieve a 20% renewable share by 2020 and a carbon-free economy by 2050, stressing coherence between energy, trade, and agricultural policies to ensure affordability, competitiveness, and environmental sustainability.",

It acknowledged the stress tests conducted on 145 EU and 20 non-EU reactors, identifying four key improvement areas: updating guidelines for natural hazard assessments, strengthening periodic safety reviews, ensuring containment integrity, and minimizing risks from natural hazards. The resolution urged immediate implementation of safety upgrades, estimated to cost €10-25 billion for 132 EU reactors, with costs borne by operators, not taxpayers. It called for stricter oversight via national action plans monitored by ENSREG, regular progress reports, and EU-level proposals to establish a nuclear safety supervision mechanism. The Parliament highlighted gaps in addressing aircraft crash risks, off-site emergency preparedness (noting 47 EU plants with over 100,000 residents within 30 km), and radioactive waste disposal in high-risk zones, urging cross-border cooperation and adherence to IAEA standards. It stressed the independence of regulators, workforce training, and public transparency, while advocating revised EU legislation, including an ambitious Nuclear Safety Directive and liability frameworks. The resolution also urged non-EU countries, particularly neighbors like Turkey and Belarus, to adopt stress tests and align with international safety norms, leveraging the Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation to promote global standards.",

High energy prices, driven by fragmented markets and rising taxes, alongside carbon costs under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), have eroded competitiveness, leading to plant closures and dependency on imports. The resolution stressed the strategic importance of base metals—including steel, aluminum, copper, and rare earths—for downstream industries like automotive, aerospace, and renewable energy, warning against new dependencies. It called for urgent ETS reforms, including free allowances for the 10% most efficient installations in carbon-leakage sectors by 2021–2030, harmonized compensation for indirect energy costs at the EU level, and investments in low-carbon technologies like carbon capture and renewable energy. The Parliament emphasized the need for robust trade defense instruments against dumping and unfair subsidies, referencing global overcapacity and advocating for streamlined anti-dumping investigations. It highlighted the circular economy’s potential, urging incentives for metal recycling and stricter waste legislation, while stressing the role of international climate agreements, particularly the Paris Agreement, to level the playing field. The resolution also underscored the importance of energy market integration, long-term electricity contracts for industry, and skills retention to preserve industrial know-how, noting that 65% of EU business R&D spending originates in manufacturing. Transparency in carbon accounting and the use of ETS revenues, alongside diplomatic efforts to secure raw material supplies, were also prioritized.",

The resolution urged the Commission to establish a clear, EU-wide definition and conduct impact assessments to address tax biases, reduce red tape, and expand funding access for mid-cap family businesses excluded from SME-specific programs. It called for enhanced support for internationalization, digitalization, and vocational training, emphasizing family businesses’ role in niche markets and innovation. Gender disparities were underscored, including a 16% gender pay gap and underrepresentation of women in leadership, with recommendations to protect women’s succession rights and promote work-life balance through childcare support and social security reforms. Agricultural family businesses were recognized for preventing rural depopulation and promoting sustainability. The resolution further demanded tax reforms to ease inheritance burdens, improve equity financing, and foster cross-border collaboration, while advocating for EU-level initiatives like a dedicated Commission unit and a \"family business test\" to evaluate legislative impacts.",

It emphasized the critical role of ORE, particularly offshore wind, which has seen a 48% cost reduction (€0.071/kWh by 2020) and requires investments of nearly €800 billion by 2050, with two-thirds for grid infrastructure. The resolution highlighted binding ORE capacity targets of at least 60 GW by 2030 and 340 GW by 2050, urging Member States to exceed these goals and prioritize cross-border collaboration, especially in underdeveloped sea basins like the Atlantic, Mediterranean, Baltic, and Black Sea. It called for streamlined permitting processes, alignment of maritime spatial plans with national energy strategies, and investments in port infrastructure, grid interconnections, and hybrid projects combining energy generation and transmission. The Parliament stressed the importance of protecting marine ecosystems, avoiding strictly protected areas, and mitigating environmental impacts through sustainable design and circular practices, including a 2025 EU landfill ban on decommissioned wind turbine blades. It advocated for enhanced R&D in floating wind, tidal, and wave technologies, workforce upskilling, and integrating ORE with renewable hydrogen production. Market reforms were urged to phase out fossil subsidies, ensure fair cost-benefit distribution, and leverage EU funds like the Connecting Europe Facility. The resolution underscored a just transition for workers, public participation in planning, and alignment with biodiversity and circular economy goals to ensure an inclusive, competitive, and sustainable energy transition.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the adoption of the Horizon Europe specific programme, establishing a €83.397 billion budget for 2021-2027 (increased by an additional €2.79 billion in constant 2018 prices) to advance research, innovation, and address global challenges. The programme prioritizes climate action, allocating at least 35% of its budget to climate objectives, and dedicates €8.952 billion to the \"Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment\" cluster. Structured across three pillars—Excellent Science (supporting frontier research via the European Research Council, Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, and research infrastructures), Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness (targeting health, digital, climate, energy, and security through six thematic clusters), and Innovative Europe (bolstering SMEs and start-ups via the European Innovation Council and innovation ecosystems)—the programme integrates missions to address societal challenges, guided by mission boards. It emphasizes synergies with EU policies, including the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals, and allocates 25% of EU Recovery Instrument funds to health, digital, climate-energy-mobility clusters, and the EIC. Key operational objectives include fostering open science, gender equality, international cooperation, and responsible innovation, while enhancing industrial transformation and risk finance access. Governance structures include independent Scientific and EIC Boards to ensure scientific excellence and innovation-driven strategies, with work programmes adopted via transparent procedures. The programme also prioritizes widening participation across member states and strengthening the European Research Area.",
