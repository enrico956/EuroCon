It highlighted Daphne’s role in addressing structural gender-based violence, including domestic abuse, sexual violence, trafficking, and harmful practices like female genital mutilation, while noting new challenges such as online violence and social exclusion exacerbating risks for marginalized groups like Roma women. The resolution emphasized the societal cost of violence, citing a Daphne project estimating annual EU costs of conjugal violence at €16 billion, and referenced studies indicating 20-25% of European women experience physical violence and 26% of children face physical abuse. Parliament urged maintaining dedicated funding within the new programme, simplifying grant procedures for NGOs, expanding eligibility to candidate countries, improving data collection on violence prevalence, and prioritizing prevention, education, and policy changes. It called for targeted actions to address emerging forms of violence, support small NGOs, enhance cross-border cooperation, and ensure the Commission leverages Daphne’s outcomes to influence national and EU policies, while demanding explicit inclusion of anti-violence objectives in the Rights and Citizenship Programme’s mandate.",

Despite constituting nearly 50% of the rural working-age population, women represent only 45% of the economically active population, manage 30% of EU farms, and perform 35% of agricultural work, often as unpaid family laborers without social security or professional status. The resolution highlighted structural barriers, including limited access to land ownership (80.1% of spouses lack ownership rights), underutilization of EU funds (only 28% of training beneficiaries and 19% of farm investment beneficiaries are women), and gaps in digital infrastructure (27.8% rural access to next-gen broadband). It called for gender mainstreaming in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), targeted measures under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), and improved access to education, vocational training, and STEM fields to enhance women’s economic empowerment. Key proposals included promoting female entrepreneurship, ensuring social protections (maternity leave, pensions), closing gender pay and pension gaps, and expanding childcare and healthcare services to support work-life balance. The resolution urged Member States to strengthen women’s participation in decision-making bodies, enforce equality legislation, and collect gender-disaggregated data to better inform policies. It also advocated for a European Charter for Women Farmers to address discrimination and recognize their contributions, while stressing the need for sustainable rural development through diversification, green jobs, and digital connectivity to retain populations and enhance resilience.",

It highlighted systemic barriers such as gender stereotypes, workplace discrimination, sexual harassment (55% of EU women face harassment since age 15), and socioeconomic inequalities, which hinder women’s participation and contribute to a gender pay gap and pension gap. The resolution emphasized that closing the STEM gender gap could boost EU GDP per capita by 2.2–3.0% by 2050. It called for integrating gender equality into education policies, including early STEM exposure, teacher training to counter biases, and promoting female role models. The Parliament urged measures to address AI and algorithmic biases by ensuring diverse development teams and gender-disaggregated data, alongside ethical frameworks to prevent discrimination. It stressed the need for work-life balance policies, including childcare support and the implementation of the Work-Life Balance Directive, to retain women in STEM careers. Entrepreneurship initiatives were highlighted, with women representing only 17% of start-up founders and receiving 2% of venture capital, prompting calls for dedicated funding, mentorship, and the expansion of programs like the EU Prize for Women Innovators. The resolution also emphasized addressing intersectional discrimination, improving digital access for marginalized groups, and leveraging EU funds (Erasmus+, ESF+) to support women’s education and career transitions. Finally, it urged the adoption of the Women on Boards Directive and stronger enforcement of pay transparency to advance gender equality in leadership and innovation-driven sectors.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised critical concerns about persistent gender inequalities in the EU, highlighting a 16% gender pay gap, rising to 40% when accounting for employment disparities, and a 37% pension gap. It noted that no EU country has achieved full gender equality, with progress at a slow pace of one point every two years, projecting over 60 years to reach parity. The resolution emphasized systemic issues, including underrepresentation of women in decision-making roles (less than a third of parliamentarians), disproportionate unpaid care work (75% by women), and heightened risks of poverty—20% of women face poverty or social exclusion, exacerbated by COVID-19, which increased gender-based violence (3,500 annual femicides) and labor market dropouts. It stressed intersectional discrimination affecting marginalized groups and called for urgent adoption of stalled initiatives: the 2008 Anti-Discrimination Directive, the 2012 Women on Boards Directive (blocked for seven years), and EU ratification of the Istanbul Convention. The Parliament urged establishing a dedicated Council configuration on gender equality to mainstream intersectional approaches, unblock legislation, harmonize policies, and address gender-based violence as a Eurocrime. It highlighted the need for gender-responsive budgeting in EU funding and recovery plans, improved childcare access to reduce employment gaps, and reinforced data collection to inform targeted policies.",
