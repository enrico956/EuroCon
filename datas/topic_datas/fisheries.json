    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the EU's position as the world's largest market for fishery and aquaculture products, valued at €55 billion and 12 million tonnes in 2007, while noting its growing reliance on imports due to a self-sufficiency rate below 40% and projected demand increases of 1.5 million tonnes by 2030. It emphasized sustainable management of fish as a renewable resource to prevent stock depletion and protect coastal communities globally, urging strengthened international fisheries governance and trade rules. The resolution called for the EU to leverage its role as the top importer to promote high environmental and social standards in WTO and FAO agreements, ensuring trade aligns with sustainability and poverty reduction. It advocated treating fish as sensitive products under WTO rules, exempting them from industrial NAMA frameworks, and applying safeguards to balance trade with conservation. The Parliament stressed that all imports must meet EU health standards and supported measures against illegal fishing, including the EU’s regulation to block illegally caught fish, while recognizing the need to assist developing countries in compliance and enforcement efforts.",

The agreement prioritizes access for EU vessels to surplus resources in Côte d’Ivoire’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) without exceeding maximum sustainable yield, ensuring local nutritional needs and food security take precedence. It builds on a previous protocol (2013-2018), which achieved a 79% average uptake of fishing opportunities but saw underuse by longliners, and emphasizes alignment with Côte d’Ivoire’s Strategic Plan for Fisheries (PSDEPA) and Blue Growth Action Plan, requiring over €140 million for sectoral development. The EU’s €273 million multiannual contribution via the European Development Fund complements sectoral support targeting infrastructure, health, and artisanal fishing, with specific measures to improve conditions for women in fish processing, strengthen local fisheries organizations, and enhance monitoring against illegal fishing. The resolution calls for transparent use of funds, including public reporting on sectoral support outcomes, and urges adherence to ILO standards, particularly Convention No. 188, to ensure fair labor conditions for Ivorian seamen, who should constitute 20% of EU vessel crews. It stresses the need for improved data collection on catches and resource sustainability, regular joint scientific evaluations, and regional cooperation to harmonize fisheries management. Parliament further demands annual reports to ensure accountability and alignment with Côte d’Ivoire’s sovereignty over resources, while advocating for local job creation, investment in the blue economy, and equitable distribution of by-catch to empower artisanal fishers and coastal communities.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the lack of a clear EU-wide definition for recreational fisheries, which complicates regulation, data collection, and assessment of its environmental and economic impacts. It highlighted that recreational fishing, involving 8.7–9 million people in Europe fishing 77 million days annually, contributes significantly to fishing mortality (2–72% of total catches for specific stocks, e.g., 13–72% for European eel) and generates an estimated EUR 10.5 billion in economic impact, supporting 99,000 jobs. The resolution stressed the need for robust, harmonized data collection under Regulations (EU) 2017/1004 and 1380/2013 to integrate recreational catches into stock assessments and management plans, particularly for vulnerable species like sea bass and cod. It urged the Commission to propose a uniform definition distinguishing recreational from commercial and semi-subsistence fishing, prohibit sales of recreational catches, and expand EMFF support for data collection, research, and sustainable tourism initiatives. The Parliament emphasized balancing recreational and commercial fishing to protect small-scale fisheries, while addressing environmental impacts such as plastic debris from lost gear and advocating for gear-specific evaluations. It called for EU-wide management measures, including catch limits and improved monitoring, to align recreational fishing with CFP objectives, ensuring ecological sustainability and socioeconomic benefits for coastal communities.",

It highlighted that only 16 out of 23 coastal Member States provided information on their allocation methods in 2020, often with vague or incomplete details, and stressed the need for Member States to publish clear, objective criteria to ensure fairness and sustainability. The resolution noted that historical catch levels remain the dominant allocation criterion, which risks economic concentration and barriers for new entrants, while incentives for low-impact fishing practices are underutilized. It emphasized the importance of supporting small-scale coastal fisheries, citing disparities in bluefin tuna quotas (e.g., 3.03% allocated to small-scale vessels in Italy vs. 36.93% in Spain) and urged Member States to prioritize environmental sustainability, social equity, and generational renewal, including using the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) to aid young fishers. The Parliament criticized the EU’s failure to meet the 2020 deadline for achieving good marine environmental status and maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for all stocks, despite progress in regions like the north-east Atlantic (99% of landings from sustainably managed stocks in 2020). It called on the Commission to enforce compliance with Article 17, initiate infringement procedures against non-transparent Member States, and develop guidelines and impact assessments to align quota allocations with biodiversity and climate goals, including voluntary targets for environmentally sustainable fishing. The resolution also urged addressing legislative gaps to implement international fisheries agreements and ensure equitable access to marine resources in line with UN Sustainable Development Goals.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the imperative to balance offshore renewable energy expansion with environmental protection, fisheries sustainability, and socio-economic cohesion, emphasizing the EU’s climate neutrality goal by 2050 and the need to increase offshore wind capacity from 12 GW to 300 GW by 2050, alongside 40 GW of ocean energy. It stressed the necessity of rigorous environmental impact assessments, life-cycle management of offshore wind turbines (25-30 years), and improved recycling methods (currently 85-90% recycled), while cautioning against adverse effects on marine ecosystems, fisheries displacement, and biodiversity. The resolution highlighted the disproportionate impact on small-scale coastal fisheries (80% of EU vessels) and called for stakeholder collaboration, fair compensation for affected fishers, and exclusion zones to protect traditional fishing grounds. It advocated maritime spatial planning to mitigate conflicts, promote multi-use maritime spaces, and integrate floating wind technology to reduce visibility and spatial overlap. Concerns included electromagnetic fields from cables, underwater noise, and artificial reef effects, urging further research and standardized monitoring. The Parliament underscored the need for cross-border cooperation, particularly in the Northern Seas (85% of EU offshore wind), and prioritized funding for outermost regions to reduce fossil fuel dependency. It insisted on applying the precautionary principle, ensuring ecosystem-based approaches, and aligning offshore projects with the European Green Deal’s objectives, including renewable hydrogen development and community energy schemes. The resolution also called for EU legislation to safeguard fisheries’ inclusion in planning and address cumulative socio-economic impacts.",
