The resolution welcomed the 2013 Joint Communication on the EU’s comprehensive approach, stressing its focus on conflict cycles (prevention, crisis response, recovery) and the security-development nexus, while cautioning against subordinating poverty eradication and humanitarian principles (neutrality, impartiality, independence) to foreign policy objectives. It called for enhanced early warning systems, gender mainstreaming in external actions, and an EU strategy for fragile states integrating OECD-DAC principles and the 2011 Busan \"New Deal.\" Climate diplomacy was underscored, urging the EEAS to leverage the 2015 Paris UN climate conference. The resolution criticized inadequate implementation of regional strategies, citing the Sahel’s 2011 strategy as a failure until Mali’s crisis, and demanded lessons-learned analyses. It stressed joint programming, alignment of trade and foreign policies, and the use of 2014–2020 financial instruments, including the Partnership Instrument, to support conflict prevention and peace-building. Gender equality measures included increasing female leadership in delegations, combating child marriage, and addressing gender-based violence in conflicts. The EU was urged to strengthen its UN role, pursue a unified UN Security Council seat, and ensure humanitarian aid remains distinct from political agendas. Finally, it emphasized coherence between internal policies and external goals, particularly in migration and climate, while safeguarding democratic oversight of external financing.",

It called for establishing a permanent EU Operational Headquarters within the European External Action Service (EEAS) to improve planning and conduct of military operations, alongside reforms to the ATHENA financing mechanism to better support EU battlegroups, which remain underutilized despite their potential as rapid reaction tools. The Parliament underscored the urgency of meeting the Helsinki Headline Goal (deploying 60,000 troops in 60 days) and closing capability shortfalls through initiatives like the European Defence Agency (EDA), including joint ownership of strategic assets and increased EU funding for defence research. It advocated for stronger EU-NATO cooperation, interoperability, and streamlined multinational structures, while urging Member States to advance permanent structured cooperation under the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen collective defence commitments. The resolution also emphasized the importance of satellite programs (Copernicus, Galileo) and cyber defence strategies, alongside proposals to enhance training, exercises, and education under a common European framework.

The resolution condemned the use of forced abortions and sterilisations, noting that abortions beyond six months are illegal under Chinese law, and highlighted the Ankang municipal government’s admission of wrongdoing, sanctions against officials, and compensation to Feng’s family. It underscored the broader consequences of the one-child policy, including widespread sex-selective abortions and gender imbalances, and reaffirmed principles from international agreements emphasizing voluntary, informed reproductive choices. The Parliament urged the EU to prioritize forced abortion in bilateral dialogues with China, welcomed public debate facilitated by online platforms, and stressed the need to protect victims’ families from harassment while advocating for reproductive rights, freedom of expression, and continued scrutiny of China’s population policies.",

The resolution highlighted underfunding of the CFSP budget, urging adequate financial resources for crisis responses and greater transparency in financing military operations, including scrutiny of the Athena mechanism and the new Lisbon Treaty start-up fund. It prioritized energy security through diversification, renewable energy, and projects like Nabucco and the Constanța-Trieste pipeline, while addressing climate change as a security threat. Regionally, the EU was urged to deepen engagement in the Western Balkans (supporting Kosovo’s EULEX mission), Eastern Partnership (enhancing visa liberalization and Black Sea Synergy), Middle East (reinvigorating Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts), and Asia (backing Afghanistan/Pakistan reforms and condemning Iran’s human rights abuses). The resolution advocated strengthening multilateralism via UN reform, transatlantic cooperation on global challenges, and partnerships with emerging powers, while criticizing China’s human rights record and supporting Taiwan’s inclusion in international bodies. It called for consolidating the EEAS’s structure, phasing out redundant EU Special Representatives, and ensuring gender balance in appointments. Lastly, it emphasized Africa’s security needs (extending EUNAVFOR Atalanta until 2010) and Latin American partnerships via trade agreements, while urging denunciation of the WEU Treaty to align with Lisbon’s framework.",

Concerns were highlighted over public skepticism, with only a minority of citizens viewing EU membership favorably, urging enhanced outreach. Constitutional reforms in June 2010 were praised but critiqued for omitting protections for LGBT rights and ecological sustainability. Judicial reforms reduced case backlogs but faced resource shortages, with 25% of parliamentary seats held by women, though gender wage gaps persisted. Regional cooperation was emphasized, including resolving border disputes with Slovenia (via a 2010 arbitration agreement), Serbia, and Bosnia, alongside reconciliation efforts such as joint visits to war sites and extradition agreements. Economic challenges included GDP contraction, labor market rigidity, and fragmented agricultural sectors, requiring structural reforms. Environmental and transport infrastructure alignment with EU standards was urged, alongside Croatia’s participation in CSDP missions like EU NAVFOR Atalanta. The resolution stressed that Croatia’s accession should incentivize Western Balkan neighbors to pursue reforms, underscoring the need for continued post-accession reforms to maximize EU benefits.",

The Parliament stressed the need to increase collaborative R&D, align civilian and military research (notably via Horizon 2020), and secure EU funding for initiatives like the European Security and Defence College and satellite capabilities (e.g., GMES). It warned that failure to address fragmentation and underfunding would perpetuate dependency on external actors, as seen in the Libya intervention, and undermine Europe’s global security role.",

Al-Nashiri faces charges under the Military Commissions Act of 2009 for his alleged role in the 2000 USS Cole attack (17 killed, 40 wounded) and the 2002 MV Limburg attack (1 killed), with the prosecution seeking capital punishment pending approval by a U.S. military convening authority. The resolution reiterated the EU’s opposition to the death penalty, torture, and unfair trials, urging U.S. authorities to avoid executing al-Nashiri, close Guantánamo, and ensure fair trials compliant with international standards. It criticized the resumption of military commissions under President Obama, emphasizing that such trials fail to meet fair trial norms, and called for investigations into CIA rendition programs and human rights violations, including al-Nashiri’s claims of secret detention in Poland. The Parliament urged EU institutions and member states to press the U.S. on these issues, cooperate in resettling Guantánamo detainees, and uphold prohibitions on torture and arbitrary detention, reaffirming the EU’s commitment to global abolition of the death penalty and respect for human dignity.",

The resolution condemned China’s refusal to grant refugees access to UNHCR procedures, its collaboration with North Korean authorities in tracking defectors, and the detention of activists like Kim Young-hwan under national security charges. It urged North Korea to implement UN Human Rights Council recommendations, allow independent inspections of detention facilities, and cease punitive practices like family imprisonment and forced abortions. The Parliament called on China to end repatriations, decriminalize humanitarian aid to refugees, grant legal status to stateless children and North Korean women in forced marriages, and facilitate safe passage to South Korea. It further urged the EU and member states to enhance protection for refugees, support NGOs assisting them, and prioritize human rights in dialogues with China, emphasizing the need for international accountability and humanitarian access to address the crisis.",

The resolution highlighted the 2013 EaPIC program allocations to Moldova, Georgia, and Armenia as rewards for reform progress and urged swift signing and implementation of Association Agreements, including Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs), to modernize economies and governance. It called for enhanced energy security through infrastructure integration, renewable energy promotion, and energy clauses in agreements, alongside addressing external pressures, particularly from Russia, which perceives the EaP as a threat. The Parliament stressed the role of civil society, youth exchanges (e.g., Erasmus+), educational initiatives (e.g., Eastern Partnership University), and communication strategies to increase public awareness of EU benefits. It urged concrete measures to support democratic transitions, combat corruption, and resolve frozen conflicts through confidence-building, while advocating for targeted sanctions against human rights violators. The resolution also recommended a post-Vilnius Summit green paper to reassess the EaP’s strategic direction, improve EU visibility, and foster synergies with regional actors to ensure stability and prosperity in the Eastern neighborhood.",

It highlighted that up to 3,000 Eritreans flee monthly due to rights abuses, with over 4,000 deaths since 2008 and around 1,000 currently held captive in Sinai, subjected to torture, sexual violence, organ trafficking, and ransom demands. The resolution condemned Egypt’s and Israel’s insufficient efforts to combat trafficking, noting collusion between Sudanese/Egyptian security forces and traffickers, and criticized Egypt’s denial of UNHCR access to detained migrants. It urged Egypt to enforce its anti-trafficking laws, protect victims under its constitution, and address Bedouin marginalization through socioeconomic development. The Parliament called for regional cooperation among Egypt, Israel, Sudan, and Eritrea, alongside EU support for victim protection, asylum procedures compliant with non-refoulement principles, and pressure on Israel to repeal indefinite detention of asylum seekers. It emphasized EU action to dismantle Sinai-based criminal networks exploiting families in Member States and endorsed funding for NGOs aiding survivors, while urging Sudan to secure refugee camps like Shagarab. The resolution also demanded accountability for traffickers and complicit officials, improved data collection on victims, and prioritized the crisis in EU dialogues with affected states.",

It condemned crackdowns on peaceful protests, including a 2010 demonstration by 1,000 Tibetan students in Tongren and 400 in Beijing opposing language policy shifts, and highlighted the marginalization of Tibetan in schools, where all subjects except Tibetan and English are taught in Mandarin, disadvantaging students and threatening cultural survival. The resolution urged China to uphold constitutional guarantees (Article 4) and regional autonomy laws (Article 10) protecting minority languages, implement genuine bilingual education allowing Tibetan as the medium for subjects like math and science, and address employment barriers faced by Tibetan graduates due to language disparities. It called for adherence to the UN Declaration on Indigenous Peoples (Article 14), ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and transparency in media access to Tibetan regions. The EU was urged to allocate €1 million (2009 budget) to support Tibetan civil society, monitor China’s compliance, and dispatch diplomats to assess the situation, stressing the need to preserve Tibetan culture both within China and in exile.",

It stressed the need for a proactive, coherent EU foreign and security policy, urging strategic reflection to develop a new European Security Strategy addressing geopolitical shifts, threats like terrorism, cyberattacks, and hybrid warfare, and emphasizing enhanced coordination between EU institutions, Member States, and NATO. The resolution called for reforms to strengthen the European External Action Service (EEAS), including streamlining decision-making, integrating EU Special Representatives, modernizing EU delegations with security experts in conflict zones, and improving financial flexibility to expedite crisis response, citing delays due to rigid budgetary rules and shortages in the CFSP budget (€396 million commitments in 2013) and the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace. It highlighted the importance of energy security, advocating reduced dependence on Russian energy, diversification of supplies, and a European Energy Union, while stressing coherence between external action and human rights obligations under Article 21 TEU. The Parliament condemned Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, supported scalable sanctions tied to Minsk Agreement compliance, and urged solidarity among Member States in relations with Russia. It emphasized revising policies toward the southern neighborhood, focusing on democratization, countering extremism, and migration management, including addressing root causes and enhancing humanitarian aid for refugees. Cybersecurity, defense cooperation via NATO and the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), and modernizing military capabilities through pooling resources (noting 80% of defense spending remains national) were prioritized, alongside calls for stricter arms trade controls and nuclear disarmament. The resolution advocated stronger partnerships with the US, Asia, and Latin America, UN Security Council reform, climate security strategies, and EU leadership in global initiatives like the post-2015 development agenda. It also urged support for eastern neighbors through Association Agreements, conditionality-based assistance, and alignment with EU values, while criticizing Russia’s destabilizing actions in Georgia and Moldova and calling for a unified response to misinformation campaigns.",

The resolution highlighted the EU’s role in supporting AU capacity-building, including the operationalization of the 25,000-strong African Standby Force (ASF), and noted the EU’s €717.9 million commitment to AU peacekeeping in 2014-2015, contrasting with the AU’s minimal €25 million contribution. It called for increased EU Member State contributions to UN peacekeeping, as only 11 of 28 states pledged troops at the 2015 Leaders’ Summit, and urged reforms to align development funding with security needs, including revising EDF rules to allow peace-related expenditures. The resolution stressed conflict prevention, addressing root causes like radicalization, unemployment, and climate change, and condemned sexual exploitation in PSOs, advocating rigorous accountability and gender-sensitive training. It criticized over-reliance on military solutions and urged holistic approaches linking security with development, governance, and human rights, while cautioning against diverting development funds to military purposes. The Parliament also advocated integrating the APF into the EU budget for transparency and backed initiatives like the Békou Trust Fund for coordinated crisis response, while calling for AU burden-sharing and improved EU-AU political dialogue to sustain long-term peace and stability.",

The resolution denounced systemic human rights abuses, including crimes against humanity documented by the UN Commission of Inquiry (2014), such as extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention of over 100,000 people in camps, forced labor, and severe restrictions on freedoms of expression, religion, and movement. It called for accountability via the International Criminal Court and targeted sanctions against perpetrators, urging China to leverage influence over North Korea to de-escalate tensions and protect refugees from forced repatriation. The Parliament stressed resuming Six-Party Talks for denuclearization, ending state-sponsored forced labor exports, addressing abductions of foreign nationals, and ensuring humanitarian aid reaches vulnerable populations. It demanded North Korea grant access to UN monitors, abolish the death penalty, release political prisoners, and uphold international human rights conventions, while urging the EU to maintain pressure through diplomatic engagement and cooperation with South Korea.",

It demanded their immediate release, citing concerns over Dr. Medani’s health and the Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Services’ (NISS) repressive tactics to stifle dissent, including unlawful detentions under the National Security Act, which permits up to four and a half months’ detention without judicial review. The resolution urged Sudan to uphold international human rights standards, including freedoms of expression, assembly, and women’s rights, and to repeal Article 152 of its Penal Code, which criminalizes \"indecent\" attire, while calling for ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). It welcomed the 2014 Addis Ababa Agreements on National Dialogue and Constitutional Process but stressed the need for inclusive participation of opposition groups, civil society, and women in addressing conflicts in Darfur, Southern Kordofan, and Blue Nile, which have caused humanitarian crises and displacement. The Parliament called for legal reforms, an end to harassment of NGOs and humanitarian workers, and unhindered humanitarian access to conflict zones. It urged the EU and African Union to support dialogue between Sudan and South Sudan, implement the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and back the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel’s efforts. Finally, it emphasized the need to combat impunity, ensure transitional justice, and establish democratic governance through inclusive elections and constitutional reforms.",

It stressed that data transfers to third countries must ensure a level of protection \"essentially equivalent\" to EU law, as mandated by the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While welcoming improvements in the Privacy Shield over Safe Harbour—such as clearer definitions, oversight mechanisms, and mandatory compliance reviews—the resolution highlighted unresolved issues, including US bulk data collection under Presidential Policy Directive 28, which lacks strict necessity and proportionality under EU standards. It noted SMEs, representing 60% of Safe Harbour users, require legal certainty for transatlantic operations, given the economic significance of US-EU trade (USD 1.09 trillion in 2014) and cross-border data flows (50% higher than US-Asia flows). Criticisms included the insufficient independence and authority of the US Ombudsperson for handling surveillance complaints and the complexity of redress mechanisms for individuals. The Parliament urged the Commission to address deficiencies, seek clarifications on US legal assurances, fully implement recommendations from the Article 29 Working Party, and conduct periodic reviews of the Privacy Shield’s adequacy, particularly after the GDPR’s full application. It called for continued dialogue to strengthen data privacy, trade, and security frameworks while balancing fundamental rights and law enforcement needs.",

Enforcement mechanisms were deemed insufficient, with a burdensome five-step redress process for individuals and weak penalties for non-compliance, such as mere removal from the Privacy Shield list. The resolution criticized US government surveillance practices, noting that bulk data collection under Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28) and retention for up to five years violated EU necessity and proportionality standards, as affirmed in the Schrems judgment. It also found the ombudsperson role inadequate due to lack of independence and inability to confirm remedies or surveillance targeting. The Parliament warned that PPD-28’s non-legislative status created legal uncertainty, as it could be revoked unilaterally, and noted ongoing US legislative changes, like Rule 41 amendments, further eroding privacy. While acknowledging improvements over Safe Harbour, the resolution concluded the Privacy Shield failed to address core issues, risking legal challenges and market distortions favoring US companies. It urged the Commission to negotiate stronger safeguards, include a two-year sunset clause, and initiate infringement proceedings against Member States adopting non-compliant surveillance laws.",

Highlighting the case of Shagufta Kausar and Shafqat Emmanuel—a Christian couple sentenced to death in 2014 based on unsubstantiated allegations of sending blasphemous text messages, despite their illiteracy and lack of evidence—the resolution condemned systemic flaws in judicial processes, including coerced confessions, prolonged pretrial detention, and inadequate medical care for detainees. It noted over 1,855 blasphemy charges filed between 1987 and February 2021, with 2020 marking the highest number of accusations, exacerbating a climate of fear, forced conversions, and violence against minorities. The resolution urged Pakistan to repeal blasphemy laws (specifically Penal Code sections 295-B and C), ensure fair trials, protect legal professionals and witnesses, and address rampant misuse of these laws for personal vendettas or political gain. It called for an immediate review of Pakistan’s eligibility for the EU’s GSP+ trade benefits, citing non-compliance with human rights obligations, and pressed for international pressure to safeguard religious freedoms, end forced conversions, and halt the death penalty. The Parliament also condemned anti-French rhetoric in Pakistan linked to blasphemy disputes and urged enhanced protections for journalists, activists, and vulnerable groups facing online and offline attacks. Finally, it reiterated opposition to capital punishment and demanded urgent medical care and release for unjustly detained individuals, emphasizing the laws’ incompatibility with Pakistan’s constitutional and international human rights commitments.",

It urged Kazakhstan to release political prisoners, reform electoral laws, cease digital surveillance, criminalize domestic violence, and protect ethnic minorities fleeing persecution, including granting refugee status to Murager Alimuly and Kaisha Akankyzy. The Parliament welcomed Kazakhstan’s abolition of the death penalty but called for accountability for torture and corruption (ranked 94th on the 2020 Corruption Perceptions Index). It urged the EU to leverage the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to condition deeper ties on human rights progress, support civil society through funding, and consider targeted sanctions under the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime against officials responsible for abuses.

The conflict, which displaced 1.9 million people in Tigray and spread to Afar and Amhara, has left 5.2 million in Tigray facing acute food insecurity, with 100,000 children at risk of severe malnutrition and 91% of the population reliant on aid. All parties—Ethiopian, Eritrean, and Tigrayan forces—were implicated in violations, including blocking humanitarian access, with only 10% of required aid reaching Tigray due to obstructions, looting, and attacks on aid workers, resulting in 23 deaths since November 2020. The resolution demanded an immediate ceasefire, withdrawal of Eritrean and Amhara forces from Tigray, and Tigrayan forces from Amhara and Afar, alongside unrestricted aid access, accountability for war crimes, and independent investigations into ethnic-targeted violence. It urged Ethiopia to ratify the Rome Statute, protect refugees, restore basic services, and cease hate speech, while calling for EU sanctions under the Global Human Rights Sanctions Mechanism if conditions do not improve. The EU allocated €53.7 million in 2021 for humanitarian aid, €118 million for Tigray and refugees in Sudan, and proposed an additional €30 million, while postponing budget support to Ethiopia. It endorsed AU and UN mediation efforts, pressed the UN Security Council to act, and condemned Ethiopia’s expulsion of seven UN officials. The resolution emphasized the conflict’s regional destabilization risks and urged coordinated international action to address suffering and uphold human rights.",

It condemned the violent crackdown on protests, including the use of live ammunition, sexual violence, and internet shutdowns, resulting in at least 70 deaths, hundreds injured, and 15 documented attacks on healthcare facilities. The resolution denounced the military’s consolidation of power through appointments linked to the former al-Bashir regime, immunity grants to security forces, and economic control via military-owned companies in key sectors. It highlighted Sudan’s dire humanitarian crisis, with 6.2 million needing aid in 2022, acute food insecurity affecting 2.7 million people, and a 300% inflation surge exacerbating poverty. The Parliament urged independent investigations into human rights violations, accountability for perpetrators—including Omar al-Bashir’s extradition to the ICC—and demanded the military restore civilian rule with clear timelines, inclusive dialogue, and elections by July 2023. It called for international pressure, including EU sanctions under the Global Human Rights Regime, and stressed the need to sustain humanitarian aid, notably the EU’s €88 million support since 2019 and a €10 million December 2021 contribution to the WFP. The resolution emphasized ending external support for Sudan’s military, halting arms exports used for repression, and ensuring transparency in EU-Sudan migration cooperation to avoid enabling oppression. It further urged ratification of the Rome Statute, establishment of the Darfur Special Criminal Court, and protection of civilians in conflict zones like Darfur, where militia looted WFP supplies meant for 800,000 people.",

The resolution urged impartial investigations into state violence, unconditional release of political detainees, and respect for freedoms of expression, assembly, and press, noting over 100 journalist rights violations and Uganda’s low press freedom ranking (125th globally). It criticized Uganda’s anti-LGBTQ+ laws, COVID-19-related raids on shelters, and discrimination, while calling for EU sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, conditionality in aid (noting €578 million in EU development funds), and support for accountability mechanisms, including the ICC’s conviction of LRA commander Dominic Ongwen for war crimes.

It highlighted the need to combat illicit financial flows, tax evasion, and money laundering within the EU, including stricter regulation of \"golden visa\" programs and enforcement of anti-corruption directives under Article 83 TFEU. The Parliament urged support for whistleblowers, journalists (noting five journalists investigating corruption were killed by October 2021), and civil society, alongside measures to protect them from retaliation. It stressed transparency in public procurement, political financing, and media ownership, and demanded accountability for COVID-19-related corruption, including misuse of emergency powers and inequitable vaccine distribution. Environmental corruption, particularly in extractive industries, and gendered impacts like sextortion were underscored, with calls for gender-sensitive anti-corruption policies. The resolution also emphasized aligning EU external action with anti-corruption goals, including binding clauses in trade agreements, support for judicial independence, and reforms to international frameworks such as UNCAC and OECD conventions. It advocated for an EU-led coalition against kleptocracy, the creation of a UN Special Rapporteur on corruption, and explored mechanisms like an International Anti-Corruption Court to address grand corruption.",

Rusesabagina, known for sheltering 1,268 people during the 1994 genocide and awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, was forcibly transferred from Dubai to Rwanda in August 2020 under disputed circumstances, denied access to chosen legal counsel, and faced politically motivated terrorism-related charges linked to 2018 attacks. The resolution condemned Rwanda’s violations of international obligations under the ICCPR, Convention against Torture, and Universal Declaration of Human Rights, citing restricted fair trial guarantees, confiscation of legal documents, and inadequate medical care for Rusesabagina, a cancer survivor deprived of prescribed medication. It urged an independent investigation into his arrest, demanded his right to a fair trial, and called for EU monitoring of his case, including prison visits and diplomatic pressure. Broader concerns included Rwanda’s repression of dissent, restrictive media laws, transnational targeting of critics in seven countries since 2014, and a Global Freedom Score of 22/100. The Parliament urged Rwanda to ratify the International Convention on Enforced Disappearances, implement UN Human Rights Council recommendations, ensure judicial independence, and uphold freedoms of expression and assembly.

It condemned threats to strip citizenship, gender-based repression, and attacks on workers’ rights, while welcoming EU sanctions against 59 individuals, including Aliaksandr Lukashenka, and pushed for broader sanctions targeting regime-linked entities. The Parliament urged freezing EU funds to Belarusian state projects, expanding support for civil society, victims of repression, and exiled students, and establishing an international investigation mechanism with UN and OSCE involvement. It reiterated demands to abolish the death penalty, ensure media freedom, and implement a European Magnitsky Act to sanction human rights violators globally. The resolution also endorsed the Sakharov Prize for Belarus’ democratic opposition, calling for enhanced diplomatic pressure and solidarity with protesters seeking democratic change.",

It denounced the November 2020 constitutional referendum, which saw a 23.7% turnout and 66.8% approval, for consolidating military influence and failing to ensure inclusivity. The Parliament urged Algeria to release all political detainees, repeal repressive laws (notably Articles 75, 79, 95 bis, and 144 of the Penal Code), ensure judicial independence, and align legislation with international human rights standards, including the ICCPR and UNCAT. It expressed alarm at 41 femicides in 2020, restrictive laws on religious minorities, and Algeria’s decline to 146th in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index. The EU called for prioritizing human rights in bilateral relations, supporting civil society, and leveraging the EU-Algeria Association Agreement to uphold democratic principles, press freedom, and gender equality.",

It highlighted systemic repression in Russia, including over 300 political prisoners, a pattern of politically motivated killings (e.g., Boris Nemtsov, Sergei Skripal), and the targeting of dissent through harassment, impunity, and electoral manipulation, notably during the 2020 regional elections where Navalny’s \"smart voting\" strategy challenged pro-government candidates. The resolution demanded an independent international investigation involving the OPCW, UN, and EU, urging Russia to disclose its Novichok program and comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention. It called for EU sanctions, including asset freezes targeting corrupt individuals linked to Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, a Magnitsky-style human rights mechanism, and the suspension of Nord Stream 2. The Parliament stressed the need to reassess EU-Russia relations, prioritizing support for Russian civil society, independent media, and democratic reforms, while isolating Russia internationally until it adheres to human rights, rule of law, and democratic principles enshrined in its constitution and international obligations.",

The resolution emphasized strengthening resilience through enhanced military and civilian cyber capabilities, deeper cooperation among Member States and EU institutions, and the development of secure communication networks and common standards. Key initiatives included the 2018 Cyber Defence Policy Framework (CDPF), the 2019 Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox with restrictive measures imposed in July and October 2020, and the Cybersecurity Act (2019) to establish ICT certification schemes. The Parliament advocated for increased investment in AI, quantum computing, and dual-use technologies, alongside the creation of the Joint Cyber Unit and the Cybersecurity Competence Centre (2020) to reduce dependencies on non-EU technologies and foster innovation. It highlighted EU-NATO collaboration, PESCO projects like Cyber Rapid Response Teams, and alignment with international law, including the UN Charter and OSCE confidence-building measures. The resolution stressed gender-inclusive policies, public-private partnerships, and international cooperation through the Indo-Pacific strategy (2021) and UN frameworks to promote global norms. Funding mechanisms such as the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), Horizon Europe, and the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) were underscored as critical for bolstering cybersecurity infrastructure and strategic autonomy across Member States.",

It condemned the March 2021 arson attack in Kakuma that killed a Ugandan LGBTIQ+ refugee and highlighted escalating violence, including armed robberies, sexual assaults, and targeted attacks against vulnerable groups, amid deteriorating security and severe shortages of food, water, healthcare, and infrastructure exacerbated by COVID-19. The resolution noted Kenya’s role as a regional refugee host despite criminalizing same-sex relations, with approximately 300 LGBTIQ+ refugees in Kakuma facing persecution in their home countries. It urged Kenya to halt camp closures until regional stability is achieved, ensure voluntary, safe repatriation, and enhance camp security, while stressing the EU’s responsibility to resettle refugees, particularly LGBTIQ+ individuals, and increase humanitarian aid, including €15 million allocated in 2021 and €45 million via the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa since 2016. The Parliament called for equitable COVID-19 vaccine access (noting only 3% of Kenyans were fully vaccinated and 2,000 doses allocated to Kakuma), adherence to international law, and collaboration with the UNHCR on the agreed June 2022 camp closure roadmap. It emphasized addressing root causes of displacement in the Horn of Africa, including conflict, climate crises, and poverty, and urged the EU to leverage its LGBTIQ+ Equality Strategy and Toolkit to advocate for decriminalization across Africa, while ensuring development funds prioritize human rights, refugee integration, and sustainable solutions aligned with the Global Compact on Refugees.",

The resolution denounced the harassment and imprisonment of critics, including journalist Maria Ressa and Senator Leila de Lima, detained for five years on politically motivated charges, and condemned gender-based violence and discrimination perpetuated by laws like the Revised Penal Code. It urged immediate investigations into killings, compliance with international human rights standards, and cooperation with the ICC’s probe into crimes against humanity (2011–2019), while criticizing the Philippines’ withdrawal from the Rome Statute. The EU called for amending the Anti-Terrorism Act, ensuring free 2022 elections amid disinformation risks, and leveraging the GSP+ trade scheme—benefiting 26% of Philippine exports (€1.6 billion in 2020)—to enforce human rights benchmarks, threatening its suspension if violations persist. Additional demands included ending arms exports usable for repression, protecting indigenous rights, and supporting civil society, while urging accountability for state-backed paramilitary groups and police implicated in abuses.",

The resolution stressed the need for climate diplomacy to integrate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience into EU foreign policy, trade agreements, and security strategies, while addressing climate-induced migration—projected to affect up to 200 million people by 2050—through international legal frameworks for \"climate refugees.\" It highlighted the EU’s role as the largest provider of public climate finance, advocating for 30% of the EU budget to support climate-related initiatives and leveraging partnerships to phase out fossil fuels, promote renewables, and transfer green technologies. Gender equality, indigenous rights, and human rights were underscored as central to climate action, with calls to address women’s underrepresentation (12-15% of delegation heads) in climate negotiations. The EU was urged to lead multilateral efforts, strengthen carbon pricing mechanisms, and collaborate with international bodies like the G20, Arctic Council, and UN agencies, while pressuring sectors like aviation and shipping to reduce emissions. The resolution also emphasized support for vulnerable regions, including small island states and the Arctic, and stressed the importance of local governance, scientific research, and civil society engagement in achieving climate justice and sustainable development.",

It condemned the disproportionate post-coup measures, including the imprisonment of opposition politicians like HDP leaders and Kurdish mayors, and highlighted Turkey’s decline to 155th in press freedom rankings. The resolution criticized the April 2017 constitutional referendum, conducted under emergency conditions with alleged irregularities, for consolidating executive power and undermining checks and balances, as noted by the Venice Commission. It reiterated calls to suspend EU accession negotiations if constitutional reforms proceed unchanged, citing non-compliance with Copenhagen criteria, and urged Turkey to reverse measures violating judicial independence, including the dismissal of 4,000 judges. The Parliament condemned Turkey’s threats to reintroduce the death penalty, which would end accession talks, and urged compliance with ECHR rulings. It expressed alarm over violence in southeast Turkey, where 2,000 were killed and 500,000 displaced, and called for renewed peace efforts on the Kurdish issue. The resolution acknowledged Turkey’s hosting of 3 million refugees and stressed the need for sustained EU support under the 2016 migration deal while urging Turkey to grant refugees work permits and education access. It condemned Turkey’s violations of Greek and Cypriot sovereignty, including airspace incursions and gas exploration in Cyprus’ EEZ, and called for troop withdrawals from Cyprus and adherence to UN resolutions. The Parliament emphasized the importance of EU-Turkey cooperation on counter-terrorism, trade, and energy but insisted on conditionality tied to human rights, urging reforms to anti-terror laws for visa liberalization and modernization of the Customs Union with human rights clauses. Finally, it called for accountability for human rights abuses, protection of minorities, cultural heritage, and religious freedoms, and urged Turkey to normalize relations with Armenia and cease inflammatory rhetoric against EU members.",

It highlighted that over 150,000 people were detained, 78,000 arrested on terrorism charges, and 50,000 remained jailed, often without due process, alongside reports of torture and prolonged solitary confinement. The Parliament condemned Turkey’s misuse of anti-terror laws to suppress dissent, including journalists (160 media outlets closed, 114,000 websites blocked), academics, opposition figures like Selahattin Demirtaş (whose detention the European Court of Human Rights ruled unlawful), and civil society leaders such as Osman Kavala. It noted the dismissal of 152,000 civil servants and the replacement of elected officials in the southeast with government-appointed trustees, undermining local democracy. The resolution criticized Turkey’s failure to protect minorities, including Kurds, Christians, Alevis, and LGBTI individuals, citing bans on Pride events, property rights violations, and destruction of cultural heritage. It urged Turkey to implement ECtHR rulings, ensure judicial independence, and reverse measures under Law No. 7145 that perpetuate emergency-era powers. The Parliament called for suspending EU accession talks due to Turkey’s failure to meet Copenhagen criteria, while advocating for modernizing the Customs Union conditional on democratic reforms. It stressed the need to uphold refugee rights (noting Turkey hosts 3.5 million Syrians) and condemned Turkey’s military actions in Syria, violations of Cypriot sovereignty, and territorial disputes with Greece. The resolution also highlighted cuts to EU pre-accession funds (€146.7 million in 2019) and redirected support to civil society, urging Turkey to align with international law and resume good-faith negotiations on Cyprus reunification.",
