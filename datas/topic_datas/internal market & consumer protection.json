Despite 20 years of existence, the Single Market remains incomplete due to Member States’ failure to fully transpose approximately 1,500 directives and 1,000 regulations, with transposition deficits rising from 0.7% in 2009 to 1.2% in 2012 before improving to 0.9%, undermining trust in the EU. The resolution called for enhanced governance, including a legislative framework under Article 26(3) TFEU, to improve transposition, implementation, and enforcement of rules, balancing economic, social, and environmental priorities while integrating consumer protection, social rights, and sustainability. It stressed the importance of reducing regulatory burdens for SMEs and micro-enterprises through tailored legislation, while safeguarding health and safety standards, and advocated for one-stop shops, digital market completion, and accessible services for persons with disabilities. The Parliament highlighted fragmented services markets, low labor mobility, and administrative barriers, urging simplified recognition of professional qualifications and smarter IT tools to empower citizens and businesses. Social cohesion, fiscal convergence, and prevention of social dumping were emphasized, alongside calls for consistent enforcement of EU directives, strengthened cross-border cooperation, and alignment of national action plans with EU guidelines to foster growth, employment, and a level playing field. The resolution also linked Single Market governance to the European Semester, advocating for a coherent framework to address market deficiencies, support regional growth, and integrate accessibility under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.",

The resolution urged stricter national enforcement, including shorter payment terms (ideally 30 days), mandatory transparency on payment behavior, and administrative sanctions for non-compliance. It highlighted the economic cost of late payments, estimating €158 million daily savings and 6.5 million additional jobs if delays were reduced. Recommendations included promoting mediation services, SME training in credit management, leveraging digital payment technologies, and aligning public procurement rules with prompt payment principles.

Citing evidence from national surveys and laboratory tests, the resolution emphasized that such practices mislead consumers, undermine trust in the single market, and constitute unfair commercial practices under Directive 2005/29/EC (UCPD). It welcomed the Commission’s allocation of €2 million to the Joint Research Centre (JRC) to develop a harmonized testing methodology by end-2018, alongside initiatives like the New Deal for Consumers, which proposes amending the UCPD to explicitly prohibit marketing products as identical when their composition differs significantly. The resolution called for stricter enforcement, cross-border cooperation among national authorities, penalties for non-compliance, and transparency measures such as a public database of test results. It urged manufacturers to avoid misleading packaging, clearly inform consumers of regional recipe variations, and consider EU-wide quality logos, while stressing that product differentiation must not lower quality or exploit purchasing power disparities. The Parliament also advocated for a specialized EU monitoring body to oversee compliance and highlighted the need to protect SMEs, local producers, and consumer rights through enhanced support for consumer organizations and stricter application of competition law.",

It urged the Commission to establish minimum resistance criteria for products, focusing on robustness, repairability, and upgradeability, and to combat planned obsolescence through an EU-wide definition, independent testing systems, and penalties for manufacturers. The resolution emphasized improving consumer information via a voluntary EU label indicating product durability, repairability, and lifespan, supported by standardized manuals and digital tools, while noting that 77% of EU consumers prefer repairing goods over replacements. It advocated for accessible spare parts, affordable repair services, and support for SMEs in the repair sector, highlighting job losses in the Netherlands (2,000 jobs lost in 7 years) and Germany (13% repair shop closures annually). The Parliament encouraged modular design, extended producer responsibility, and public procurement favoring durable goods, alongside fiscal incentives like Sweden’s VAT reduction (25% to 12%) on repairs and tax deductions for repair costs. Measures against software obsolescence included mandatory security updates, reversible upgrades, and compatibility requirements. The resolution also stressed harmonizing national initiatives, such as France’s criminalization of planned obsolescence and Austria’s repair-friendly appliance label, to strengthen the internal market, reduce electronic waste, and align with the Ecodesign Working Plan 2016-2019 and Circular Economy Package objectives.",

It highlighted declining competition, with 29% of tenders receiving single bids by 2016 and SMEs securing only 45% of high-value contracts, below their economic contribution. The resolution urged Member States to expedite transposition of the directives, prioritize strategic procurement to advance sustainability, innovation, and social inclusion (criticizing the overreliance on lowest-price criteria in 55% of procedures), and adopt life-cycle costing and MEAT (most economically advantageous tender) criteria. It called for accelerated digitalization, including mandatory e-procurement tools like eForms by 2018, contract registers, and cross-border interoperability, while reducing administrative burdens for SMEs through measures like mandatory lot division and simplified bidding. Internationally, the Parliament stressed the need to address third-country market barriers, noting that over half of global procurement markets remain closed despite €352 billion of EU procurement being open to WTO GPA members, and advocated leveraging trade agreements and the proposed International Procurement Instrument. It emphasized professionalization through national strategies, EU-funded training, and ethical standards, while urging the Commission to finalize guidance on innovation, social procurement, and life-cycle methodologies, and to improve data collection to enhance transparency and combat corruption.",

It highlighted that approximately 1 million deaf sign language users and 51 million hard-of-hearing individuals in the EU face systemic barriers, including insufficient access to qualified sign language interpreters, with ratios ranging from 8:1 to 2,500:1 (average 160:1) per user. The resolution stressed the necessity of professional sign language interpretation as a critical accessibility measure or reasonable accommodation in education, employment, healthcare, justice, and public services, noting disparities in TV subtitling (10%-100% coverage) and the lack of standardized interpretation data. It urged Member States to promote sign language learning, ensure bilingual education with qualified interpreters, and adopt minimum accessibility standards for digital and emergency communication. The EU institutions were called to lead by example, providing equal status for sign language interpreters, improving staff accommodations, and implementing projects like INSIGN for real-time sign language services. It also criticized the exclusion of sign language interpretation from the European Disability Card Pilot Project, which hinders mobility, and emphasized the need for inclusive Erasmus+ programs, accessible political processes, and data collection via Eurostat to inform policy. The resolution underscored that accessibility and reasonable accommodation are complementary obligations, with disproportionality claims invalidating denial of access, and affirmed sign languages’ linguistic equality, urging their integration into EU multilingualism policies.",

It emphasizes strengthening producer organizations (POs) for collective bargaining, enhancing transparency via price monitoring tools, and revising competition rules to address retailer-owned brands’ anti-competitive risks. Cross-border cooperation and harmonization are critical to prevent forum shopping and ensure equitable market conditions, safeguarding farmers’ viability and consumer interests.",

Key issues include the TSD’s chemical provisions, which allow derogations for carcinogenic, mutagenic, or reprotoxic (CMR) substances and maintain age-based distinctions for chemical limits (e.g., toys for children under 36 months), despite evidence of manufacturers circumventing these rules. The resolution calls for eliminating derogations for CMRs, aligning nitrosamine limits with stricter German standards and EN 71-12:2017 (0.5 mg/kg for nitrosamines, 1.0 mg/kg for nitrosatable substances), and removing age distinctions to apply uniform chemical limits. It highlights the fragmentation of chemical regulations across multiple EU laws (e.g., REACH, RoHS), advocating consolidation under the TSD to streamline compliance. Endocrine disruptors and combination effects of chemicals, unaddressed in the current TSD, should be incorporated, reflecting the EU Chemical Strategy for Sustainability. Market surveillance improvements are urged, citing the 2020 EU Safety Gate report where toys accounted for 27% of unsafe product notifications. The resolution supports implementing Regulation 2019/1020 to enhance enforcement, including online marketplaces, and leveraging technologies like blockchain for traceability.

It stressed that deepening integration could unlock up to €297 billion (2% of EU GDP) and address post-COVID-19 economic recovery, noting that 14 million manufacturing-related jobs depend on services. Key priorities included enforcing the Services Directive and Professional Qualifications Directive to reduce fragmentation, digitalizing cross-border procedures for SMEs, and eliminating unjustified national regulations, territorial restrictions, and language barriers. The resolution urged Member States to fully implement revised Posting of Workers Directive protections, accelerate mutual recognition of qualifications across all education levels, and expand the European Professional Card to more professions, including engineering. It called for stricter enforcement of proportionality tests under the Proportionality Test Directive, improved compliance with the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive, and enhanced accessibility under the European Accessibility Act. The Parliament highlighted the need to leverage digital tools like the Single Digital Gateway and Points of Single Contact to streamline administrative processes, while urging vigilance against COVID-19-related service restrictions. It pushed for the Single Market Enforcement Task Force (SMET) to establish transparent metrics, address non-tariff barriers, and align reforms with the European Green Deal and social rights. Additionally, the resolution emphasized public procurement harmonization for green services, stricter monitoring of social security coordination, and an EU-wide social security number to combat fraud. Criticizing delayed transposition of directives in 20 Member States, it demanded annual progress reports, updated single market scoreboards, and stakeholder-driven evaluations to close enforcement gaps and achieve a sustainable, inclusive single market.",
