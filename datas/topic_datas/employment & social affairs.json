The resolution highlighted alarming youth unemployment rates exceeding 50% in Greece, over 30% in Portugal and Ireland, and 26.4% in Cyprus, alongside a 15% loss of 2 million jobs across the four countries since 2009, disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups like women, migrants, and persons with disabilities. Austerity measures led to significant cuts in social spending, healthcare, and pensions, violating fundamental rights and increasing homelessness, energy poverty, and in-work poverty, with rising Gini coefficients indicating worsening wealth inequality. The programs were criticized for lacking social impact assessments, disregarding ILO conventions and the European Social Charter, and weakening collective bargaining through labor market deregulation, wage cuts (e.g., 22% minimum wage reduction in Greece), and precarious employment. Parliament urged corrective actions, including social recovery plans, compliance with EU treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, enhanced social dialogue, and targeted measures to restore education, healthcare, and social protection systems. It called for prioritizing job creation, reversing procyclical austerity, conducting pre-reform social impact assessments, and aligning future policies with Europe 2020 targets to ensure upward social convergence, sustainable growth, and respect for human dignity.",

The resolution emphasized aligning the scheme with Europe 2020 goals, including 75% employment for 20-64-year-olds, reducing early school-leaving below 10%, and lifting 20 million out of poverty. It called for EU funding, particularly allocating at least 25% of Structural Funds to the European Social Fund (ESF) to support implementation, while stressing balanced EU-national financing. The Parliament highlighted the need for personalized assessments, tailored services, and quality frameworks for education/training offers, including fair pay and working conditions. It urged cooperation between EU institutions, member states, social partners, and local authorities, and supported monitoring via an Employment Committee and the European Semester to track progress, name non-compliant states, and assist financially constrained members. Reforms in education and labor market policies were emphasized to address skills mismatches and precarious employment trends.",

It highlighted disparities across Member States, including rising malnutrition and school dropout rates (over 20% in Portugal, Spain, and Malta), and emphasized that children in single-parent households (49.8% at risk) and those with low parental work intensity (56.7% higher risk) were disproportionately affected. The resolution urged Member States to prioritize child-focused policies under the Europe 2020 strategy, including access to adequate resources, quality services (education, healthcare, housing), and child participation, while leveraging EU Structural Funds and implementing the Commission’s 2013 recommendation \"Investing in Children.\" Key measures included establishing a binding EU sub-target to reduce child poverty, ensuring universal access to early childhood education (below 15% coverage in 11 countries), and adopting multidimensional indicators to assess deprivation. It called for strengthened social protections, including minimum income schemes, affordable childcare, and labor policies supporting parental employment, while opposing austerity-driven cuts to public services. The resolution also stressed addressing energy poverty, malnutrition, and housing insecurity (17% of EU children in unsafe housing) and advocated for a \"Child Guarantee\" to ensure free healthcare, education, and nutrition for disadvantaged children. Member States were urged to transition from institutional care to family-based support, promote inclusive education, and integrate migrant and marginalized children into social policies. Finally, it emphasized the economic cost of child poverty and the need for cross-sectoral, rights-based approaches to break intergenerational cycles of disadvantage.",

The resolution called for improved data transparency, simplified procedures for microfinance intermediaries (MFIs), synergies with EU funds like the European Social Fund (ESF), and enhanced training and mentoring to boost business viability, noting that 44% of supported micro-enterprises survived less than a year. It stressed expanding geographical coverage beyond 22 Member States, increasing support for the social economy, and addressing high application rejection rates (nearly 2,000 rejections, often due to over-indebtedness). Recommendations included leveraging the more flexible EaSI program to address shortcomings, prioritizing vulnerable groups, and ensuring equitable access to foster economic growth and social cohesion.",

The Parliament stressed the need for education, training, and entrepreneurship programs targeting youth, women, and disadvantaged groups, alongside enhanced data collection, visibility, and platforms for best practices. It also advocated tax incentives, state aid flexibility, and integration of SSE into National Reform Programmes to boost job creation, social innovation, and cohesion, particularly in sectors like green and digital economies.",

It highlighted a 6.1% economic contraction in 2020, with projected growth of 4.2% in 2021 and 4.4% in 2022, alongside unemployment rates of 7.6% in 2021 and 7% in 2022, remaining above pre-crisis levels. The resolution stressed the urgency of leveraging the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) to align national recovery plans with the European Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR), the Green Deal, and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring reforms and investments prioritize social inclusion, quality job creation, and upward convergence. It called for addressing gender inequality, noting women spent 18.4 hours weekly on unpaid care during lockdowns (compared to men’s 12.1 hours) and advocated for pay transparency, improved care infrastructure, and closing the 21% wage gap in long-term care sectors. The Parliament urged Member States to prioritize youth employment, reskilling, and affordable housing, citing a €57 billion annual investment gap in social housing, and emphasized integrating social and environmental objectives into fiscal policies, including tax reforms to combat avoidance and fund robust welfare systems. It demanded stronger collective bargaining, minimum wage frameworks, and enhanced public health systems to address pandemic-induced labor market disruptions, while ensuring RRF-funded projects avoid exacerbating inequalities and prioritize green and digital transitions that protect workers’ rights and social dialogue.",

        "stance": "ECR rejects the directive's mandatory pay transparency measures as incompatible with national labor models and existing successful policies in member states like Poland.  \nECR opposes fundamentally the EU's overreach into wage-setting mechanisms, arguing such matters fall outside EU competence and must remain under national sovereignty.  \nECR highlights contradictions with subsidiarity principles, noting Poland’s 4.5% gender pay gap was achieved without EU mandates, rendering centralized bureaucracy redundant.  \nECR condemns the proposal’s administrative burdens on SMEs, warning it would penalize small businesses critical to economies like Italy’s through costly compliance requirements.  \nECR challenges the issue’s ideological framing, asserting it prioritizes gender theory over merit-based recognition and exacerbates regulatory strain amid existing Green Deal pressures."

        "stance": "ID partly promotes the directive's intent but absolutely disputes with its opposition to EU overreach into national labor policies. The proposal's transparency mandates create workplace discord, inconsistent with ID's emphasis on social cohesion.  \n\nID requests revisions to eliminate Articles imposing pay comparison mechanisms, which undermine subsidiarity by displacing national collective bargaining systems proven effective in member states like Denmark.  \n\nThe proposal overlooks critical aspects such as existing anti-discrimination laws' sufficiency, redundantly adding bureaucracy that burdens SMEs recovering from pandemic impacts, contravening ID's economic priorities.  \n\nID rejects the directive's assumption that gender pay gaps stem primarily from employer bias, noting it fails to address root causes like occupational segregation and family choices central to ID's policy analysis.  \n\nThe issue's enforcement mechanisms impose a presumption of employer guilt, conflicting with ID's principles of fair legal process and partnership-based labor relations."

        "stance": "GUE_NGL strongly sanctions the pay transparency obligations in Articles 4-6, which align perfectly with the group’s longstanding commitment to dismantling systemic gender pay discrimination.  \nGUE_NGL applauds the recognition of intersectional discrimination as a critical advancement toward addressing compounded inequalities faced by marginalized women.  \nGUE_NGL proposes amending Article 8 to lower the company size threshold from 100 to 50 employees, mirroring Spain’s proven model that combines pay assessments with equality plans without burdening SMEs.  \nGUE_NGL emphasizes that the permitted 5% unexplained pay gap risks legitimizing disparities and urges member states to adopt stricter national thresholds pending future EU-level elimination.  \nThe issue effectively advances GUE_NGL’s priority of linking pay equity to broader structural reforms, particularly redistributing unpaid care work and combating gendered occupational segregation."

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised its position on the Commission’s 2021 proposal (COM(2021)0093) concerning employment and social policies, adopting its first-reading stance to advance legislative measures aimed at enhancing gender equality, workers’ rights, and social protections across the EU. The resolution, developed jointly by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, emphasized the need for robust enforcement mechanisms, including mandatory pay transparency measures to address gender pay gaps, and expanded protections for vulnerable workers, such as those in precarious or non-standard employment. It called on the Commission to resubmit the proposal to Parliament if substantial amendments are made, ensuring continued legislative scrutiny. The Parliament also instructed its President to formally transmit its position to the Council, Commission, and national parliaments, underscoring the urgency of aligning EU-wide policies with principles of social justice, non-discrimination, and equitable labor market participation.",
