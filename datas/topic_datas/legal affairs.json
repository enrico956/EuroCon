It noted a significant decrease in reasoned opinions from national parliaments in 2014 (21 opinions addressing 15 proposals, with 506 total submissions), attributing this partly to fewer Commission proposals and no \"yellow card\" or \"orange card\" triggers that year, though the mechanism had functioned in 2012 and 2013. Participation among national chambers dropped by 50%, with only 15 chambers submitting opinions. The resolution highlighted deficiencies in Commission impact assessments, with 32% of those reviewed in 2014 lacking adequate subsidiarity or proportionality analysis, and urged the Commission to improve explanatory statements and conduct enhanced proportionality assessments, including environmental, social, and economic impacts. It welcomed the 2015 Better Regulation package, which aimed to strengthen subsidiarity justifications, and supported proposals for a \"green card\" mechanism allowing national parliaments to suggest legislative initiatives, while cautioning against undermining EU institutional processes. The Parliament called for extending the eight-week period for national parliaments to issue reasoned opinions under Protocol No 2, suggested Treaty revisions to expand subsidiarity checks to include proportionality, and stressed the need for interparliamentary cooperation through tools like IPEX and COSAC. It encouraged greater engagement between EU institutions and national parliaments, including informal contacts and shared guidelines, and emphasized the role of the Committee of the Regions in assessing compliance with subsidiarity. The resolution reiterated the importance of clear, proportionate legislation and urged robust EU action where added value is demonstrable, balancing efficiency with democratic accountability.",

It stressed that adoption decisions must prioritize a stable, loving environment for the child, ensure biological parents’ rights to exhaust legal remedies before parental authority is withdrawn, and avoid economic status as the sole basis for adoption. The resolution highlighted gaps in cross-border recognition of domestic adoptions, noting that families moving within the EU face legal uncertainties, including potential re-adoption requirements, due to the absence of automatic recognition mechanisms. It called for legislation by 31 July 2017 to establish automatic recognition of domestic adoption orders across Member States, conditional on compliance with public policy and jurisdictional rules under Articles 67(4) and 81(3) TFEU, while respecting the Hague Convention’s framework for intercountry adoptions. The proposed regulation would mandate mutual recognition of adoptions finalized in one Member State or recognized from third countries, barring manifest public policy conflicts, and introduce a European Certificate of Adoption to streamline administrative processes. The resolution urged enhanced judicial cooperation, specialized training for family court judges, improved transparency via the e-Justice Portal, and stronger measures to combat child trafficking and exploitation by intermediary organizations. It emphasized preserving siblings’ unity, cultural and linguistic ties for adopted children, and equitable procedural rights for cross-border relatives, including access to interpreters and legal aid. The Parliament also advocated for robust support systems for biological families to prevent non-consensual adoptions as a last resort, better data collection on transnational cases, and alignment with UN Convention on the Rights of the Child principles, particularly Article 21 on adoption safeguards.",

The resolution called for urgent revisions to expand the ELD’s scope to include ecosystems, human health impacts, and air pollution, while extending strict liability to sectors like mining, pipelines, and invasive species. It emphasized the need for mandatory financial security (e.g., insurance) for operators, harmonized liability thresholds, and a potential EU-wide fund to address insolvency or large-scale incidents. The Parliament urged the Commission to clarify key concepts, establish a public EU database for ELD cases, and strengthen enforcement through standardized inspections, criminal sanctions, and alignment with the Aarhus Convention’s access to justice principles. It also recommended removing \"permit defence\" exemptions, promoting the polluter-pays principle, and requiring biennial Member State reports on ELD application. Additionally, the resolution welcomed the 2017-2020 Multi-Annual ELD Work Programme but stressed the need for improved stakeholder awareness, guidance documents, and training to address gaps in transposition and implementation.",

The Parliament urged global cooperation on compulsory licensing for health crises, supporting TRIPS flexibilities and vaccine IP sharing, while opposing patent abuses. It called for an EU IP coordinator, stronger cross-border enforcement, and alignment of IP policies with green and digital transitions, including reforms to the Copyright Directive and Database Directive to balance innovation, access, and creators’ rights.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over fragmented implementation of the Environmental Liability Directive (ELD) and Environmental Crime Directive (ECD), citing inconsistent enforcement, lack of harmonization, and insufficient resources across Member States. It highlighted that only seven Member States maintain public ELD case registers, while 14 lack databases entirely, exacerbating regulatory gaps and legal uncertainty. The resolution emphasized the need to revise the ELD into a fully harmonized regulation, aligning it with the ECD and other EU environmental laws, while clarifying definitions like \"environmental damage\" and \"operator\" to reduce divergent interpretations. It noted the average cost of remedial action under the ELD is €42,000, but operator insolvency often shifts financial burdens to taxpayers, urging mandatory financial security instruments (e.g., insurance, bonds) to cover liabilities. The Parliament called for an EU ELD task force to improve data collection, transparency, and victim support, and stressed the urgency of addressing environmental crimes—ranked the fourth-largest international crime category—through enhanced cross-border cooperation, specialized law enforcement units, and stricter penalties. It advocated extending the European Public Prosecutor’s Office’s mandate to environmental crimes and aligning liability regimes with the Paris Agreement to address climate risks. Additionally, the resolution urged corporate accountability for transboundary harm, including parent company liability for subsidiaries’ environmental damage abroad, and emphasized integrating human rights and biodiversity protections into trade agreements. It also highlighted the need to eliminate permit and state-of-the-art defenses under the ELD unless companies prove due diligence, ensuring adherence to the polluter-pays principle.",
