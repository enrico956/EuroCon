    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over the 2013 budget’s capacity to address outstanding payment claims, noting that Draft Amending Budget No 2/2013 proposed a €11.2 billion increase in payment appropriations across multiple budget headings to cover obligations from past and current commitments, alongside a €290 million revenue boost from fines. It highlighted that €16.2 billion in unpaid cohesion policy claims from 2007-2013 had rolled over into 2013, reducing available funds, and stressed the need to honor a December 2012 interinstitutional commitment to settle unpaid 2012 claims. The resolution acknowledged the Council’s adoption of €7.3 billion as a first tranche under a June 2013 political agreement on the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), but warned this might be insufficient, particularly given late-year invoice submissions under heading 1b due to N+2/N+3 rules. It insisted on a second amending budget in early autumn to cover the remaining €11.2 billion deficit, linking its approval to the adoption of the 2014-2020 MFF Regulation and 2014 budget. The Parliament emphasized that the Commission’s data on payment needs, aggregated from member states, should not be contested by the Council, and noted that adopting a subsequent amending budget (No 3/2013) would reduce member states’ GNI contributions, partially offsetting their costs. It approved the Council’s position on Draft Amending Budget No 2/2013 but urged binding solutions if the proposed funds proved inadequate, stressing mutual trust and the imperative to prevent payment shifts into the next MFF.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over balancing fiscal responsibility with institutional needs in its 2014 budget resolution, setting draft estimates at €1,808,144,206—a 3.29% net increase from 2013. This increase included 2.20% for one-off costs linked to the 2014 European elections and new Member and assistant statutes, 1.30% for legal obligations, and 0.78% for Croatia’s full-year accession costs (€13.6 million). Adjusted for inflation (1.9%), the budget reflected a real-term decrease of 2.89%. Specific cuts targeted energy (€-0.5 million), the Official Journal (€-1 million), parliamentary assistance (€-1 million), carbon offsetting (€-0.25 million), premises fitting (€-1.25 million), and contingency reserves (€-1 million). Structural reforms since 2011, including travel reductions, video-conferencing, and streamlined translation services, were noted to save €29 million annually, with further cuts in 2014 translation (-56%), interpreting (-23%), lease payments (-60%), and web TV (-38%). The resolution emphasized maintaining multilingualism and Members’ access to services while freezing staff and Member allowances since 2007 and 2011, respectively, until 2014. It welcomed the budget-neutral internalization of security services and urged prudent management of long-term projects like the KAD building in Luxembourg, expected to reduce future rent costs. A Joint Bureau-Budgets Committee Working Group was tasked with identifying additional savings through structural reforms, inter-institutional cooperation, and efficiency measures without compromising legislative quality. The resolution also called for detailed reports on 2013 savings, election-related communication expenses, and co-financing for the European House of History, ensuring transparency and adherence to financial frameworks.",

Agricultural priorities included increased funding for decoupled aid (+9.7%), school fruit schemes (€90 million, +50%), and dairy sector support, while expressing concern over volatile markets and the need for permanent mechanisms to address price instability. External action saw demands for additional climate finance (€65 million in 2011) without diverting development funds, increased humanitarian aid, and strengthened Eastern Partnership funding. The Parliament criticized underfunding of gender equality programs, including reduced commitments for the DAPHNE initiative combating violence, and stressed the need for gender budgeting across EU policies.

It criticized the Council for reducing 2013 payments by €5 billion below the Commission’s estimates, creating a €16 billion carryover of unpaid obligations from 2012, and warned that the 2013 payment ceiling’s €11.2 billion margin would be insufficient to address existing liabilities, risking solvency and credibility. The resolution highlighted the unprecedented €217.3 billion stock of outstanding commitments (RAL) by 2012’s end, urging interinstitutional cooperation to address structural payment forecasting inaccuracies and avoid rigid de-commitment rules conflicting with the Compact for Growth and Jobs. It demanded a March 2013 draft amending budget to cover €2.9 billion in suspended 2012 claims and called for monthly reports on Member States’ payment claims to improve transparency. The Parliament stressed the EU budget’s role in driving growth, jobs, and competitiveness, noting its leverage effect as 94% of the budget—1% of EU GDP—returns to Member States through investments in education, SMEs, infrastructure, and youth employment. It opposed cuts to the EU budget, arguing this would undermine cohesion and solidarity, and urged reforms to diversify EU revenue through a financial transaction tax and EU VAT, reducing reliance on national contributions. The resolution also cautioned against staffing reductions in EU institutions without impact assessments and emphasized aligning the 2014 budget with the EU 2020 strategy and Growth and Jobs Compact to ensure synergies between national and EU-level fiscal priorities.",

The EDPS’s 2015 budget totaled €8,760,417 (a 1.09% increase from 2014), achieving a 96% implementation rate and 86.5% utilization of payment appropriations. While welcoming improved financial management, Parliament highlighted concerns over three internal control objectives requiring substantial effort, particularly the need to develop SMART targets for performance-based budgeting (PBB) across departments. It noted a gender imbalance in middle management (40% female/60% male) and urged balanced recruitment, while commending low sick leave (6.6 days average) and staff well-being initiatives. Parliament acknowledged the EDPS’s adoption of a code of conduct but criticized its lack of conflict-of-interest rules, urging public disclosure of CVs, declarations of interest, and a conflict-of-interest track record. Transparency measures, such as publishing meetings with external entities and awarded contracts, were welcomed, though more detailed mission reports were requested. The resolution emphasized the EDPS’s advisory role in critical legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation, EU-US Privacy Shield, and Europol reform, and its involvement in establishing the European Data Protection Board. It endorsed the EDPS’s 2015-2019 strategy and key performance indicators but called for clearer distinctions between internal and external metrics. Parliament urged exemption from a 5% staff reduction mandate due to increasing workloads, while welcoming compliance with transparency reforms, including whistleblowing rules (adopted June 2016) and future adherence to revolving door guidelines. Finally, it encouraged the EDPS to enhance privacy innovation in big data and emerging technologies, balancing innovation with fundamental rights protection.",

It acknowledged the Court of Auditors’ assurance on the reliability of accounts and legality of transactions, while highlighting a 98.55% budget implementation rate and a 28% carry-over for administrative expenditures (€477,994), largely due to delayed IT equipment deliveries for building refurbishment. The Centre executed 57 budget transfers (€586,100) within financial rules and increased procurement procedures by 32% (70 total), with 79% negotiated. Gender balance was emphasized, with 61% female staff, including management. Structural risks from the Centre’s location on an active fault line were addressed through completed repairs (2015) and ongoing safety measures, though concerns persisted over glass façade and skylight integrity, with repairs finalized in 2016 and liability discussions with Greek authorities ongoing. The resolution commended Cedefop’s contributions to EU vocational training policies, including the European Skills and Jobs Survey and Skills Panorama, aligning with Riga Conclusions priorities (2015–2020). It urged vigilance on salary adjustments to avoid negative staff impacts, noted internal restructuring under the Commission’s DG Employment, and called for enhanced performance measurement, transparency in conflict-of-interest declarations, and updates on building safety and financial liability.",

It urged EFSA to expand cooling-off rules to cover research funding and publish conflict-of-interest evaluations. Internal audits revealed gaps in financial ex-post controls and data governance, prompting calls for corrective measures. EFSA’s collaboration with EU agencies on antimicrobial resistance and endocrine disruptors, along with its 600+ scientific outputs and a bee health project, were commended. Gender imbalances were noted (20% female Management Board members), and costs for closed conferences (€23,096 for 31 participants) were questioned.

Budget execution rates were 90.58% (authorized) and 96.49% (payments), with €26.6 million unspent from 2014 reallocated to 2016 after delays. Carry-overs for operational expenses totaled €400,000 (44% of commitments). The resolution urged improved internal controls, including better audit certificate quality for grants, and called for finalizing whistleblowing policies, enhancing transparency in expert selection and stakeholder interactions, and addressing low public visibility of EIT initiatives. Staffing reached 59 out of 63 authorized posts, though salary challenges in Hungary persisted. The EIT’s partial financial autonomy since 2011 and ongoing efforts for full autonomy were noted, alongside concerns about coordination with EU programs and irregularities in KIC expenditures, including excessive performance-based remuneration (€646,000) and high procurement costs. The Parliament emphasized compliance with Horizon 2020 rules, sound financial management, and stronger accountability mechanisms.",

The Authority achieved a 99.97% budget implementation rate and 83.75% payment execution, with improved recruitment filling 95.6% of positions despite challenges like high Frankfurt housing costs and competition with other EU bodies. Parliament urged EIOPA to enhance transparency by publishing CVs and declarations of interest for its Management Board and Board of Supervisors, expediting publication of meeting minutes (currently delayed by up to three months), and establishing a whistleblower channel. It called for revising EIOPA’s financing model, including introducing fees for market participants to replace national contributions, and reallocating resources to prioritize supervisory convergence over legislative tasks. Concerns were raised over incomplete use of EIOPA’s legal mandate, with calls to focus on proportionality, stakeholder involvement in standard-setting, and regular reporting to Parliament and Council. Internal controls were deemed effective, though further alignment with Commission standards was noted. Lastly, Parliament stressed the need for rationalization and performance-based budgeting to maximize efficiency amid shifting priorities.",

It acknowledged a 99.64% budget implementation rate and an 84.54% payment execution rate, alongside two budget amendments reducing expenditures by €372,709. While the Court of Auditors confirmed the reliability of ESMA’s accounts and legality of transactions, unresolved corrective actions from 2011, 2012, and 2014 audits persisted, including fee calculations based on estimates rather than actual costs, prompting ESMA to develop an activity-based costing system. Staffing increased by 10.7% to 186 employees, with a gender balance of 44% female and 56% male, and 22 EU nationalities represented. Governance measures included conflict-of-interest policies for staff and non-staff, an Anti-Fraud Strategy (2015–2017), and publication of CVs and declarations of interest for board members, though Management Board declarations remained unpublished. The resolution urged ESMA to prioritize supervisory convergence over legislative tasks, enhance transparency through faster publication of meeting minutes (reducing a three-month delay) and web streaming, and establish whistleblower rules by 2017. It called for a review of ESMA’s financing model, proposing fees for market participants to replace some national contributions while safeguarding autonomy. Performance concerns included underutilization of legal mandates and delayed communication with EU institutions, stressing the need for proportional resource allocation and timely reporting on audit action plans.",

It emphasized agencies’ critical role in policy implementation impacting citizens’ lives, such as health, migration, and security, while stressing their need for autonomy and adequate resources. The resolution noted agencies’ 2015 budget of €2.8 billion (7.7% increase from 2014), with 9,965 staff (6.25% annual growth, particularly in migration and crime agencies). The Court of Auditors issued unqualified opinions for all agencies except Frontex (qualified) and flagged elevated carry-overs in 32 agencies, urging clearer distinctions between planned and unplanned carry-overs to align with multiannual programming. It called for streamlined financial regulations, improved grant management, and shared services to enhance efficiency, citing a cloud services initiative saving €2.5 million. Concerns included staff reductions (5% target by 2017) straining agencies like the European Food Safety Authority, underrepresentation of post-2004 Member States in senior roles, and insufficient gender balance. Transparency measures were urged, including stricter conflict-of-interest declarations, whistleblower protections (65% of agencies lacked internal rules), and public access to documents. The resolution highlighted Brexit’s impact on UK-based agencies and stressed the need for evaluations to optimize synergies and avoid duplication. It welcomed cooperation among justice and home affairs agencies but criticized inadequate performance indicators and structural inefficiencies. Finally, it called for resolving audit burdens from private-sector outsourcing and ensuring agencies’ operational continuity amid budgetary constraints.",

Key proposals include introducing a financial transaction tax (FTT), corporate income tax reforms (e.g., allocating part of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base revenue to the EU budget), and sustainability-linked measures such as a CO2 levy or emissions-based customs duties to incentivize climate-friendly trade and generate revenue. The resolution emphasizes modernizing the customs union (which contributed 12.8% of EU revenue in 2015) to combat fraud, improve duty collection, and address revenue losses from free trade agreements, while ensuring WTO compliance. It calls for abolishing rebates and correction mechanisms, advocating for at least 50% of EU budget revenue to come from new own resources, and stresses the need to offset Brexit-related revenue losses (€9–12 billion annually). Climate action is prioritized, with demands to align the budget with the Paris Agreement and allocate resources to high-value projects like energy transition. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is highlighted as vital, costing citizens 32 cents daily and supporting 500 million Europeans, though reforms are urged to enhance equity and environmental benefits. The resolution also supports creating a euro area budgetary capacity, a European Minister of Economy and Finance, and shifting to qualified majority voting for budgetary decisions to strengthen democratic accountability and EU added value.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over delays in applying the Regulation on conditionality linking EU funds to rule of law compliance, emphasizing its binding nature since 1 January 2021 and its critical role in safeguarding the unprecedented €1.8 trillion 2021-2027 MFF and Next Generation EU recovery package. It criticized the Commission for developing non-binding guidelines, arguing the Regulation’s text is clear and requires no further interpretation, and condemned the Commission’s failure to meet Parliament’s 1 June 2021 deadline for action. The resolution stressed the need for swift, impartial investigations into systemic rule of law breaches—such as threats to judicial independence, corruption, or misuse of funds—that directly risk EU financial interests, citing examples from the Commission’s 2020 Rule of Law Report. It called for transparency, regular reporting to Parliament starting by October 2021, and cooperation with OLAF and the EPPO to address issues like non-compliance with anti-fraud recommendations. The Parliament highlighted the Regulation’s unique scope to address both individual and systemic breaches across all EU funds, urging proportionality in measures while protecting legitimate beneficiaries’ rights. It demanded clarity on criteria for systemic breaches, timely enforcement of sanctions, and a user-friendly complaint mechanism for citizens and civil society to report violations, ensuring alignment with Directive 2019/1937 on whistleblower protection. The resolution underscored the Regulation’s role in complementing existing tools to uphold EU values and financial integrity.",
