It called for enhanced teacher training, age-appropriate cybersecurity and media literacy education, and measures to counter risks like cyberbullying and data breaches. The Parliament urged Member States to prioritize high-speed internet connectivity for all schools by 2025, promote inclusive digital tools for marginalized groups, and leverage EU funding programs like Erasmus+, Horizon Europe, and the Digital Europe Programme to support innovation, digital infrastructure, and cross-border collaboration. It stressed balancing digital skills with critical thinking and traditional competencies, warned against over-reliance on technology in early childhood education, and advocated for research into the neurological impacts of digital tools. Additionally, the resolution highlighted the role of libraries in digital inclusion, urged gender-balanced ICT education, and called for a coordinated EU-wide digital skills strategy to address labor market shifts, foster entrepreneurship, and ensure no one is left behind in the digital transition.",

Despite its symbolic importance, the programme’s budget of €185.47 million (0.0171% of the Multiannual Financial Framework) was deemed insufficient, with a 13.7% cut leading to a 25% reduction in funded projects by 2014 and a mere 6% success rate for remembrance and civil society projects in 2015, compared to higher rates in other programmes like Creative Europe. The Parliament highlighted the programme’s impact, including 1.1 million participants in 408 projects in 2015, but stressed that limited funding caused frustration among applicants and hindered goals. It called for a budget increase to €500 million (€1 per citizen) in the next MFF, simplified procedures, enhanced synergies with programmes like Erasmus+ and Creative Europe, and improved communication through a centralized online platform. Recommendations included prioritizing town-twinning initiatives, addressing contemporary challenges (migration, radicalization, social inclusion), ensuring accessibility for marginalized groups, and formalizing multiannual priorities. The resolution also urged legal reforms to grant Parliament co-legislative authority over the programme, criticized the lump-sum funding system for disadvantaging smaller organizations and regions with higher costs, and emphasized the need for transparent feedback on rejected applications. Additionally, it advocated for greater international participation, including EFTA and candidate countries, and leveraging social media to amplify outreach and promote EU values amid rising Euroscepticism.",

It highlighted persistent gaps between policy commitments and implementation, noting the lack of concrete targets and frameworks for citizenship education, particularly in the 2018 Council Recommendation on Key Competences, which inadequately addressed \"Active Citizenship.\" EU programs like Erasmus+ allocated only 0.000046% of its 2014-2020 budget to citizenship education projects, while Horizon Europe and Creative Europe dedicated 0.00002% and 0.000007%, respectively, with limited geographical reach and sustainability. The Europe for Citizens program directed 2% of its budget to six projects, and the European Solidarity Corps supported 21 projects (0.2% of its budget). The European Parliament Ambassador School Programme engaged 1,572 schools and 58,900 students by 2021 but faced challenges in rural access and formal recognition. Member states’ citizenship education varies widely, with curricula often prioritizing national over European dimensions and facing politicization in countries like Poland and Hungary. Teacher training and assessment methods remain inconsistent, with half of EU countries lacking regulations for educators. The 2016 ICCS study revealed only 35% of students had holistic civic knowledge, though 83% learned about European history, and higher civic knowledge correlated with trust in EU institutions (70% trusted the EU, 72% the Parliament). The resolution urged systemic reforms to integrate citizenship education across formal and lifelong learning, stressing the need for inclusive, participatory approaches to sustain democratic resilience.",

It highlighted that youth unemployment surged due to crises in labor-intensive sectors like retail, tourism, and hospitality, disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups, including NEETs (young people not in education, employment, or training), with gender disparities worsening outcomes. The resolution stressed the digital divide, citing OECD data showing only half of students could access most curricula online, risking long-term skill gaps. It urged increased investment in digital literacy, quality online tools, and teacher training under the Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027), alongside safeguarding in-person learning for marginalized groups. The Parliament called for expanded mental health support, tailored services for disabled youth and rural populations, and rights-based policies to protect vulnerable communities, including migrants and LGBTQI+ individuals. It emphasized the role of youth programs like Erasmus+, the European Solidarity Corps, and Youth Guarantee, advocating for 10% of recovery funds to education and 20% to digital strategies. Regarding sports, the resolution noted the sector’s economic significance (2.12% of EU GDP, 5.67 million jobs) and its societal role in inclusion and health, urging targeted relief for grassroots and professional sports through EU funds like the Recovery and Resilience Facility. It called for coordinated measures to safely resume events, address doping risks, and support clubs facing existential threats, while promoting digital innovation and cross-sector collaboration to enhance resilience. The resolution underscored the need to preserve civic spaces, youth organizations, and the European sport model, emphasizing solidarity and equitable access to mitigate the pandemic’s long-term effects.",
