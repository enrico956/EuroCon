It noted the ECB’s monetary policy actions, including two interest rate hikes (25 basis points each in April and August 2011) followed by two reductions (25 basis points each in November and December 2011), and the launch of three-year Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) totaling over €1 trillion (€489.2 billion in December 2011 and €529.5 billion in February 2012) to stabilize financial markets. Despite these efforts, credit growth to the private sector slowed sharply (from 1.6% in 2010 to 0.4% in 2011), inflation rose to 2.7% (driven by energy prices), and government debt increased to 88% of GDP. The resolution acknowledged the ECB’s Securities Markets Programme (SMP), which temporarily reduced borrowing costs for struggling states, but criticized structural shortcomings, including risks from transferring sovereign and bank liabilities to the ECB’s balance sheet (now over 30% of eurozone GDP) and excessive reliance on non-marketable collateral (23% of total). It urged greater transparency, including publication of collateral details, voting records, and SMP bond purchase prices, and called for conditional lending to boost SME credit, which employs 72% of the workforce.

Concerns were raised about low payment appropriations in the EU budget hindering economic recovery and the need for a reformed own-resources system to reduce Member States’ fiscal burdens. The resolution stressed democratic accountability in economic governance, advocating for enhanced parliamentary scrutiny of the European Semester, Troika operations, and financial assistance programs. It urged Member States to align reforms with Europe 2020 goals, address macroeconomic imbalances, and prioritize long-term sustainability of social systems, while warning against excessive debt and loss of global market shares.",

The resolution called for stricter enforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), introducing an Excessive Debt Surveillance Procedure (EDSP) to monitor debt sustainability, contingent liabilities (e.g., pensions), and fiscal consolidation timelines, aiming to realign deficits with SGP rules by 2015. It advocated for a \"European Semester\" to synchronize national budgetary and reform plans (SCPs and NRPs) with EU oversight, enhanced transparency, and involvement of national parliaments. To address crises, it proposed a permanent European stabilisation mechanism (e.g., a European Monetary Fund) based on existing tools, alongside feasibility studies for common EU bonds. Other measures included tax policy coordination to combat fraud, reinforced Eurostat powers to audit national statistics, and harmonized budget reporting. The resolution urged institutional reforms, such as consolidating Commission roles, improving Euro Group accountability, and exploring Treaty changes for deeper integration, while safeguarding ECB independence and balancing fiscal discipline with investments in cohesion, innovation, and social protections.",

It highlighted the strategic importance of leveraging the euro’s potential as a global safe haven and developing a unified, liquid bond market comparable in size to the US Treasury market but currently lacking in liquidity and pricing efficiency. The resolution welcomed the Commission’s Green Paper on stability bonds as a starting point for debate but stressed that none of its three proposed options alone address the current debt crisis. It underscored the necessity of a binding fiscal framework, akin to the Maastricht criteria, to ensure economic governance, growth, and stability culture before joint bond issuance, while addressing moral hazard and joint liability. The Parliament noted that stability bonds could incentivize compliance with fiscal rules and enhance monetary policy transmission, contingent on deeper integration and prior reforms, including measures from the December 2011 European Council. It urged rapid proposals to tackle the crisis, such as a European redemption pact, finalizing the ESM treaty, eurobills, or joint debt management, and deemed the resolution a preliminary step ahead of a comprehensive INI report. The resolution also emphasized the eurozone’s responsibility to safeguard the currency used by over 330 million people and its global economic impact.",

It highlighted implicit state guarantees benefiting large banks, estimated at USD 100 billion annually, and noted excessive banking sector concentration, with 14 EU banks classified as systemically important (SIFIs) and 15 banks holding 43% of EU banking assets (150% of EU GDP). The resolution stressed the urgency of enhancing capital and liquidity requirements, implementing recovery and resolution frameworks to ensure losses are borne by shareholders and creditors, and reducing interdependencies within banking groups. It called for stricter corporate governance, including accountability for board members, long-term remuneration structures, and transparent risk disclosure. The Parliament advocated for a principles-based EU framework to harmonize national structural reforms, such as separation of retail and investment banking, while preserving market diversity. It urged the Commission to assess reforms like the Volcker, Vickers, and EU High-level Expert Group (HLEG) proposals, promote competition through diversified banking models (e.g., cooperatives), and regulate shadow banking. The resolution also emphasized limiting bank size relative to national GDP, improving accounting standards for transparency, and ensuring robust supervision via the Single Supervisory Mechanism and European Banking Authority (EBA) to safeguard financial stability and consumer trust.",

It emphasized the role of Member States and local authorities in defining, organizing, and financing SGEI under the subsidiarity principle, as outlined in Protocol No 26 and Articles 14 and 106 TFEU, and called for simplified procedures, including higher thresholds for exempting compensation payments from notification—particularly for social services like healthcare, elderly care, and social housing—to alleviate administrative strain. The resolution advocated for recognizing \"acts of entrustment\" through objective-based contracts, urged the Commission to prevent over-compensation via triennial checks and transparent criteria, and highlighted the need to include infrastructure investment costs (e.g., energy, telecoms, transport) in compensation frameworks. It stressed balancing competition rules with SGEI’s social mission, ensuring high-quality, affordable services without market distortion, and proposed tailored *de minimis* rules for local SGEI with negligible cross-border impact. The Parliament also urged the Commission to clarify distinctions between economic and non-economic activities, enhance legal certainty, and provide guidance tools for authorities to improve compliance, while safeguarding universal access and quality in line with EU values and the Europe 2020 strategy.",

The resolution emphasized alignment with international commitments, notably the G8 Summit’s 2013 priorities and OECD recommendations, and referenced the European Commission’s 2012 proposals to address tax avoidance. It stressed the importance of harmonizing EU rules under Article 114 TFEU to ensure consistent reporting standards, improve accountability, and foster fair competition, while urging the Commission to integrate these measures with ongoing global tax transparency efforts, such as those outlined in the OECD’s September 2013 report. The Parliament also called for the Commission to avoid undermining the directive’s objectives through future amendments and to ensure timely implementation across member states.",

It condemned tax havens for enabling illicit capital flight and urged sanctions, expanded automatic information exchange, and an end to bank secrecy, emphasizing the need to combat artificial corporate structures and abusive VAT practices. The resolution highlighted the role of multinational companies in exploiting tax disparities, noting that 25% of large US firms and a third of major UK corporations paid no taxes in specific years, while French firms paid 8% effective tax rates versus 33% official rates. It called for extending EU savings taxation rules (Directive 2003/48/EC) to jurisdictions like Singapore, Hong Kong, and US states, ending derogations for Austria, Belgium, and Luxembourg, and accelerating anti-fraud agreements with Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Switzerland. The Parliament stressed improving OECD standards to mandate automatic multilateral information exchange globally, revising accounting rules for country-by-country tax disclosures, and creating an EU public register for entities in tax havens. It advocated a common EU corporate tax base to address transfer pricing, urged sanctions like levies on non-cooperative jurisdictions, and emphasized support for developing countries in building transparent tax systems. The resolution also demanded annual Commission reports on progress, starting in 2010, and highlighted the need to align EU policies with G20, UN, and OECD efforts while addressing loopholes and ensuring fair tax competition.",

The resolution stressed the necessity of a fiscal union with binding economic policy coordination, a redemption fund to manage debt, and increased EU budgetary capacity funded by own resources like a financial transaction tax (FTT) to address structural imbalances. It demanded greater parliamentary involvement in EU governance, including the European Parliament’s role in drafting the Annual Growth Survey, Economic Policy Guidelines, and oversight of the Eurogroup and European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Social priorities included a \"Social Pact for Europe\" with a youth guarantee to combat 22% youth unemployment (exceeding 50% in some states), minimum unemployment allowances, decent wages, affordable housing, and universal healthcare. The resolution highlighted the need to align national budgets with EU2020 targets, address macroeconomic imbalances, and integrate employment and social policies into economic governance, noting that EU27 unemployment had risen to 10.4% (25 million) by 2012. It urged completion of the internal market, structural reforms to boost competitiveness, and mobilization of 1% of GDP for sustainable investments, while rejecting austerity measures that undermine social protection and cohesion. Democratic accountability measures included transparency in Eurogroup decisions, regular hearings for EU officials, and enhanced roles for national parliaments in fiscal planning.",

It acknowledged the SSM’s operational success since 2014 in enhancing supervisory quality and financial stability but called for reduced administrative burdens, improved proportionality in reporting (notably for smaller banks via AnaCredit thresholds), and better integration of macro-prudential policies, including liquidity stress testing and systemic risk monitoring. The resolution highlighted challenges such as non-performing loans (urging asset management solutions), insufficient credit growth, and the need to harmonize supervisory practices by closing 35 national regulatory discrepancies. It stressed the SRM’s role in resolving failing banks, advocating swift adoption of a minimum 8% MREL requirement, bridge financing for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), and stronger cooperation between the SRB and ECB. On deposit guarantees, Parliament welcomed the proposed European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) but emphasized preconditioning it on risk reduction and BRRD implementation. Key numerical references included Greek banks’ recapitalization needs (€4.4–14.4 billion under stress tests) and the ECB’s comprehensive assessment of 2013–2014. The resolution also urged addressing sovereign exposure risks, enhancing transparency in supervisory decisions (e.g., SREP outcomes), and ensuring accountability through improved audit mechanisms and ECB engagement with Parliament. It called for global regulatory consistency, vigilance over shadow banking, and safeguarding diverse banking models while avoiding regulatory arbitrage.",

It highlighted that EU capital markets lag behind the U.S., with EU mutual funds, pension funds, equity markets, corporate bonds, and securitization at 50%, 35%, 60%, 35%, and 20% of U.S. levels respectively, despite higher EU savings (20% of GDP vs. 17% in the U.S.). The resolution emphasized simplifying regulations to enhance cross-border capital flows, promote securitization, private placements, venture capital, and digital finance, while ensuring investor protection and addressing tax biases favoring debt over equity. It called for harmonizing insolvency frameworks, improving financial education, and leveraging initiatives like ELTIFs and UCITS to mobilize institutional investors. The Parliament stressed the importance of regulatory coherence, proportionality for SMEs, and stronger supervision through ESMA, while cautioning against replicating non-EU models and urging completion of CMU components by 2018. It also underscored the need to mitigate systemic risks, avoid excessive leverage, and align the CMU with digital single market and investment plan agendas.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the European Investment Bank’s (EIB) 60-year achievements, including €1.1 trillion invested in 11,800 projects across 160 countries, with over 90% of lending within the EU. It highlighted the EIB’s 2017 record of approving 901 projects, including €78 billion for innovation, environment, infrastructure, and SMEs, and noted that 2015-2016 lending within the EU is projected to support €544 billion in investments, adding 2.3% to GDP and creating 2.25 million jobs by 2020. The resolution emphasized the EIB’s role in countering post-crisis investment gaps, with the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) mobilizing €335 billion since 2015, supporting 750,000 jobs and aiming for 1.4 million by 2020. Environmental efforts were underscored, including €16.6 billion in 2017 for climate-related projects, exceeding its 25% climate financing target, and issuing €500 million in Sustainability Awareness Bonds. The EIB’s support for SMEs and mid-caps totaled €29.6 billion in 2017, benefiting 287,000 firms employing 3.9 million people. Parliament urged reduced dollar-denominated funding (33% in 2017) to mitigate sanctions risks and called for enhanced transparency, accountability, and alignment with EU policies like the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals. It stressed the need for balanced geographical distribution, as 70% of 2017 financing went to six Member States, and supported the Economic Resilience Initiative (€6 billion over five years) for migration-affected regions. Concerns over Brexit included safeguarding the EIB’s AAA rating and equitable solutions for UK staff. The resolution also demanded stricter anti-tax avoidance measures, fossil fuel divestment, and stronger due diligence on intermediaries to prevent fraud and money laundering, while advocating for cross-border projects and deeper cooperation with national promotional banks.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised substantive points regarding the ECB’s monetary policies, economic impacts, and institutional accountability. It noted the ECB’s 2016 measures, including a -0.4% deposit rate, an €80 billion monthly asset purchase program (APP) expanded to include corporate bonds (CSPP), and targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), later adjusted to €60 billion monthly until December 2017. While acknowledging these policies supported recovery, prevented deflation, and preserved financial stability, Parliament expressed concerns over prolonged low inflation (1.5% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018, below the 2% target), uneven growth (2.2% GDP in 2017, 2.3% in 2018), and unemployment (9.6% in 2016), alongside risks like asset bubbles, pension scheme strains, and TARGET2 imbalances. It stressed the need for structural reforms, growth-friendly fiscal policies, and completion of the Banking Union and Capital Markets Union to enhance credit transmission and address non-performing loans. Parliament highlighted the ECB’s €1.19 billion net profit in 2016, driven by asset purchases, and urged transparency on collateral valuation and CSPP eligibility criteria. It called for safeguarding the euro’s legal tender status, studying digital currencies without undermining cash, and ensuring accountability through enhanced disclosure, ethical governance, and scrutiny of post-mandate conflicts. Concerns over Brexit’s financial stability impact, including euro-clearing relocation, and support for Greece’s reintegration into bond purchase programs were emphasized. Lastly, Parliament advocated aligning ECB independence with democratic accountability, including public consultations, whistleblower protections, and improved staff working conditions.",

Unemployment remained alarmingly high at 11.9% in 2013, with youth unemployment exceeding 50% in some states, exacerbating economic divergence. The ECB’s monetary policies, including lowering key interest rates to 0.05% and introducing unconventional measures like targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and asset purchases, were acknowledged for stabilizing financial markets but criticized for failing to spur credit growth, job creation, or inflation, which fell to 0.5% in 2014, far below the 2% target. Private and public investment stagnated at pre-crisis lows, with SMEs facing a 35% lending decline (2008–2013) despite employing 72% of the workforce. Financial fragmentation persisted, with uneven borrowing costs across states, while bank balance sheets remained fragile, highlighted by the ECB’s comprehensive assessment. The resolution stressed the need for structural reforms, growth-friendly fiscal policies, and public investment—such as the proposed €300 billion Juncker plan—to complement ECB actions, warning that prolonged low rates risked distorting markets and undermining savings. It called for enhanced transparency in ECB asset purchases, gender balance in appointments, and a clear separation between monetary policy and banking supervision under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Concerns over deflation risks, unsustainable debt levels (near or above 100% of GDP in many states), and social inequalities linked to austerity were emphasized, alongside calls for labor market reforms that protect workers’ rights and address poverty, which increased by 10 million people (2010–2012). The ECB’s independence and adherence to its price stability mandate were reaffirmed, while its role in the Troika was questioned for overstepping fiscal boundaries.

It urged the ECB to enhance transparency, avoid discrimination in APP implementation, and carefully manage exit strategies from unconventional tools. The Parliament welcomed initiatives like the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and the Capital Markets Union (CMU) but stressed that monetary policy alone cannot resolve structural issues, requiring fiscal consolidation and reforms.

It emphasized the need to balance short-term cyclical pressures with structural reforms to ensure sustainable growth, advocating for the European Semester’s three-pillar approach—boosting investment, structural reforms, and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation—while criticizing the low implementation rate of country-specific recommendations (9% in 2013). The resolution welcomed the EUR 315 billion Investment Plan for Europe and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) but stressed the need for rigorous project selection, additionality, and focus on SMEs, which face significant financing barriers. It called for reforms to enhance labor markets, competitiveness, energy independence, and tax systems, including fighting tax evasion and advancing a common consolidated corporate tax base. Concerns were raised about excessive public and private debt, uneven implementation of fiscal rules (only five Member States fully compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact), and the need for democratic accountability in economic governance. The Parliament highlighted the urgency of addressing unpaid EU bills (EUR 24.7 billion in 2014) and improving the EU budget’s alignment with Europe 2020 goals, including sustainable energy, education, and healthcare. It urged harmonization of national budgetary assumptions, greater use of Structural and Investment Funds (representing 10% of EU public investment), and stronger single market integration, criticizing the omission of the 2015 Single Market Integration report. The resolution also emphasized sustainable development, resource efficiency, and green job creation, linking energy security and climate targets to economic growth.",

It emphasized the need for structural reforms, increased public and private investment (still below pre-2008 levels), and enhanced productivity through R&D, digitalization, and green technologies, aligning with the Europe 2020 strategy and the Paris Agreement. The resolution called for responsible fiscal policies under the Stability and Growth Pact, urging debt reduction (euro area debt at 90% of GDP) and improved budget management, while leveraging flexibility clauses. It stressed fair taxation, combating tax evasion (highlighting lost billions in revenue), and advancing the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). Social priorities included implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights, addressing wage stagnation, integrating NEETs and refugees, and boosting the European Social Fund. Environmental sustainability was underscored, advocating for 20% of the EU budget to target climate action, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies by 2020, and transitioning to a circular economy. The Parliament supported cohesion policy (8.5% of EU government capital investment 2015-2017) and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), urging synergies with EU funds to reduce regional disparities. It called for stronger democratic oversight of EMU reforms, including transforming the ESM into a European Monetary Fund under EU law, and enhancing the European Semester process with national parliamentary involvement. Youth employment initiatives, such as the Youth Employment Initiative (€1.2 billion increase), and measures to improve CSR compliance and disaster resilience were also prioritized.",

It mandated that SBBS must comply with Articles 4, 5, and 6, ensuring transparency, risk disclosure, and structural requirements, while special purpose entities (SPEs) issuing SBBS must adhere to Articles 7 and 8, governing their operational and governance standards. The resolution introduced a tranche structure (senior, subordinated, junior) to prioritize loss absorption, with junior tranches bearing losses first. It required the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to certify SBBS compliance and maintain a public list of approved products, emphasizing that only certified SBBS could be marketed. The framework aimed to mitigate systemic risks, promote cross-border investment, and standardize SBBS issuance, while clarifying definitions of key terms like \"competent authority\" and \"original purchaser\" to ensure legal certainty and alignment with existing EU financial regulations.",

The resolution emphasized enhancing transparency and mitigating risks by mandating reporting of SFTs to trade repositories, requiring ESMA to develop technical standards specifying reporting formats, including global legal entity identifiers (LEIs) and unique transaction identifiers. Central banks of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) were exempt from reporting but required to cooperate with authorities upon request. Credit institutions and listed companies must disclose SFT activities in annual reports to inform investors and shareholders. The resolution aligned with FSB’s 2013 framework and 2014 recommendations on collateral haircuts for non-centrally cleared SFTs, urging ESMA to monitor FSB developments and prepare a report by 2016 to assess quantitative impacts and propose a consistent EU framework. Phased implementation of reporting obligations was introduced, considering counterparties’ operational readiness. ESMA was tasked with publishing annual reports on aggregate SFT volumes and overseeing trade repository registration, with a 40-day review period for applications. The Commission was mandated to evaluate the regulation’s effectiveness within 15 months, propose further measures to address leverage and pro-cyclicality, and report on circumvention risks. Delegated acts were authorized to amend exemptions for third-country central banks based on evidence of necessity, ensuring alignment with supervisory needs.",

It welcomed the ECB’s decisive monetary measures, including the expansion of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) to €1.35 trillion and targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III), to mitigate the crisis and support recovery, while urging sustained support as needed. The resolution highlighted deflationary pressures, with euro area HICP inflation at 0.3% in 2020, and called for re-evaluating inflation measurement to better reflect housing costs (24% of household expenditure) and asset price inflation. It stressed the need for fiscal-monetary policy alignment and structural reforms to address uneven recovery across Member States, warning of risks from prolonged low interest rates, including wealth inequality, unsustainable debt, and financial instability. The ECB was urged to integrate climate considerations into its operations, align collateral frameworks with the Paris Agreement, and expand green bond purchases. The resolution emphasized the importance of a digital euro, ensuring privacy, security, and coexistence with cash, while addressing risks from crypto-assets and shadow banking. It criticized the persistent gender imbalance in the ECB’s Governing Council (only 2 out of 25 members are women) and called for gender-balanced shortlists for appointments. Accountability measures included enhancing transparency, formalizing scrutiny through an interinstitutional agreement, and adopting whistleblower protections. The ECB was also urged to strengthen the euro’s international role, support Bulgaria and Croatia’s euro adoption, and address systemic risks, including Brexit-related financial stability and TARGET2 imbalances. Lastly, the resolution highlighted concerns over housing affordability (9.6% overburden rate in 2018) and cyber-security vulnerabilities, while commending the ECB’s anti-counterfeiting efforts and low counterfeit rates.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over insufficient access to documents and data necessary to assess the implementation of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC) in taxation, hindering its oversight role under Article 14 TFEU and the 2016 Inter-Institutional Agreement. Despite requests, most Member States (except Sweden and Finland) blocked access via the Commission, citing confidentiality under a 2010 agreement, leaving the Parliament reliant on limited 2015-2017 data from an Economisti Associati study and patchy public sources. The DAC framework, expanded through DAC1-4, mandates automatic exchange of tax-related information on income categories (employment, pensions, financial accounts, tax rulings, and Country-by-Country Reports for multinationals with €750M+ revenue), but gaps persist in covering capital gains, non-financial assets (e.g., art, yachts), and loopholes in financial reporting. The Parliament criticized poor data quality, inconsistent monitoring, and weak compliance checks by Member States, with only a few conducting audits or quality assessments. It urged the Commission to issue guidelines, establish a cost-benefit framework, and publish annual summaries of exchanged data. Weak anti-money laundering (AML) rules in many Member States and FATF’s low effectiveness ratings further undermine DAC’s impact. Internationally, OECD reviews found 10 EU states non-compliant with the Common Reporting Standard and 18 with material deficiencies in information exchange, highlighting systemic risks. The resolution stressed the need for rigorous enforcement of existing rules, expanded DAC scope, and improved inter-institutional cooperation to combat tax evasion, fraud, and avoidance effectively.",

The resolution emphasized the need to transition from the transitional VAT system, prone to fraud like carousel schemes, to a definitive regime based on the destination principle, taxing cross-border B2B transactions in the customer’s country. It noted disparities in VAT gaps across Member States, ranging from 1% in Sweden and Croatia to 33% in Romania, and stressed the economic burden on SMEs, with compliance costs accounting for 1-4% of turnover. The Parliament criticized fragmented VAT rates and exemptions (over 250 in the EU) for distorting the internal market, increasing compliance costs, and undermining social and environmental goals, as reduced VAT rates often fail to benefit consumers effectively, eroding tax bases by up to 22% of domestic revenue. It urged rationalizing reduced rates, harmonizing tax systems, and leveraging digitization to combat fraud and simplify processes, while advocating for the adoption of the 2018 proposal to establish a single VAT area.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the EU’s economic governance framework, emphasizing its complexity, pro-cyclical biases, and failure to reduce divergences or protect public investment, while highlighting the need for reform amid COVID-19 recovery. It noted the activation of the Stability and Growth Pact’s general escape clause until 2023 to enable fiscal flexibility, allowing Member States to adopt expansive measures (with EU aggregate debt-to-GDP exceeding 100%) and avoid premature consolidation. The resolution stressed the necessity of targeted fiscal support to address scarring effects, inequalities, and investment gaps, citing annual funding needs of €470 billion for environmental objectives, €142 billion for social infrastructure, and €190 billion to stabilize public capital. It called for a revised governance framework prioritizing sustainable growth, debt sustainability through country-specific adjustment paths, and simplified rules such as an expenditure-based system with safeguards for green and social investments. The Parliament advocated maintaining expansionary fiscal policies to support recovery, leveraging NextGenerationEU (NGEU) and SURE instruments, while ensuring transparent debt management and repayment plans. It emphasized aligning fiscal policies with the European Green Deal and social rights, integrating climate risks into debt sustainability analyses, and improving the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP) to address structural divergences. The resolution also urged stronger democratic accountability, enhanced role for independent fiscal institutions, and better coordination between EU and national levels to ensure ownership and compliance with reforms.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the need to strengthen the international role of the euro to enhance the EU’s financial autonomy, reduce reliance on the US dollar, and bolster resilience against external economic shocks. It emphasized completing the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), Banking Union, and Capital Markets Union (CMU) to deepen financial integration, increase the supply of euro-denominated safe assets, and address market fragmentation. The resolution highlighted the €750 billion Next Generation EU recovery plan as a historic opportunity to boost the euro’s global standing through joint debt issuance, including green and social bonds, with €100 billion already raised via the SURE instrument. It stressed the importance of promoting the euro in strategic sectors like energy, trade, and digital finance, noting that over half of global green bonds were denominated in euros in 2019. The Parliament called for advancing the digital euro to adapt to digital transformation, ensuring cybersecurity, and maintaining price stability. It urged reducing reliance on non-EU financial infrastructures post-Brexit, extending TARGET2 operating hours by 2022, and fostering euro-denominated clearing. The resolution also advocated for stronger EU representation in international institutions, aligning policies with climate goals under the Paris Agreement, and mitigating risks from extraterritorial sanctions by enhancing the euro’s use in trade invoicing. Challenges included addressing fragmented fiscal policies, ensuring sustainable debt management, and balancing the benefits of internationalization with potential risks like capital flow volatility. The ECB’s role in maintaining price stability and expanding swap lines to ensure global euro liquidity was underscored, alongside calls for harmonized regulations in crypto-assets and anti-money laundering frameworks.",

It stressed urgency in meeting the 10 January 2020 deadline for transposing the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), including establishing beneficial ownership registers, and highlighted risks of further delays. The resolution cited the Danske Bank case, involving over €200 billion in suspicious transactions, as emblematic of supervisory failures and criticized the rejection of a breach-of-law recommendation by national supervisors within the European Banking Authority (EBA). It underscored systemic weaknesses, including regulatory fragmentation, insufficient cross-border cooperation among Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs), and the need to consider replacing directives with directly applicable regulations to harmonize AML/CTF rules. The Parliament criticized the Commission’s February 2019 list of 23 high-risk third countries—including Afghanistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia—which the Council rejected due to procedural flaws, and called for a transparent, autonomous methodology to identify such countries, free from diplomatic interference, while proposing a \"grey list\" akin to tax non-cooperative jurisdictions. It urged increased resources for AML enforcement, welcomed the EBA’s strengthened role, and emphasized the economic impact of money laundering, citing Europol estimates that 0.7–1.28% of EU GDP (€110–190 billion annually) is linked to illicit financial flows. The resolution also advocated for a potential EU-level supervisory body and improved coordination mechanisms to address cross-border threats.",
