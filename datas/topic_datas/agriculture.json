Educational measures to promote healthy diets and reconnect children with agriculture are mandated, with EU funding covering these initiatives. Budget allocations for each Member State are based on the number of children aged 6–10, regional development levels (prioritizing less-developed regions, the Aegean Islands, and outermost regions), and historical milk program participation, with Croatia receiving a specific allocation. The co-financing requirement for fruits and vegetables is abolished, and Member States must submit six-year strategies, updated regularly, to access annual EU aid. The resolution delegates powers to the Commission to set rules on eligible costs, publicity, and distribution logistics, ensuring visibility of EU support. The amended regulations take effect from 1 August 2017, aiming to enhance efficiency, promote local products, and combat childhood obesity through targeted, sustainable interventions.",

The resolution emphasized the need for improved housing systems, such as group pens with enriched space (750–800 cm²/rabbit), access to fibrous diets, and platforms to mimic natural behavior, while acknowledging higher costs and potential market impacts. It urged the Commission to develop a roadmap for EU-wide welfare standards, including guidelines, research on health, housing, and humane stunning methods, and financial support for farmers transitioning to alternative systems. The Parliament stressed the importance of enforcing existing animal welfare directives (98/58/EC), harmonizing national rules (e.g., Austria’s cage ban, Belgium’s 2025 phaseout), and ensuring imported rabbit meat meets EU standards, given 99% of imports originate from China. It called for reduced antibiotic use to combat antimicrobial resistance, improved labeling under Regulation (EU) 1169/2011 for consumer transparency, and inclusion of rabbit meat in EU market monitoring. The resolution also noted the sector’s decline (3.9% production drop in 2016, 1.70 kg per capita consumption) and its socioeconomic role in rural employment, particularly for women, urging CAP support and dedicated research funding to address welfare, sustainability, and market challenges.",

It noted that POs, which marketed 43% of EU F&V production in 2010 (up from 34% in 2004) and involved 16.5% of producers by 2010, remain underutilized in many Member States, particularly those with small-scale producers and low modernization. The resolution highlighted the sector’s economic significance, contributing €50 billion annually and employing 550,000 people, but flagged challenges such as declining EU production area (6% reduction from 2003–2010), falling per capita consumption (387g/day in 2012, an 8.7% drop from 2007–2011), and trade deficits exacerbated by third-country tariff barriers and uneven regulatory standards. It criticized insufficient crisis management tools, with only 2.8% of EU aid allocated to crisis prevention, and urged reforms to address unfair trading practices, simplify PO rules, and restore financial support for new POs, especially in underorganized regions. The Parliament called for stronger incentives for PO mergers, transnational cooperation, and youth inclusion (noting only 7.5% of EU farmers are under 35), alongside measures to boost exports, enforce reciprocity in trade standards, and expand school fruit schemes to improve dietary habits. Environmental goals, streamlined audits, and proportionality in penalties were stressed, alongside demands for urgent action to mitigate crises like the Russian import ban and invasive species threats. The resolution underscored the need for legal clarity, reduced administrative burdens, and enhanced crisis mechanisms, including mutual funds and withdrawal price adjustments, to stabilize producer incomes and ensure sector resilience.",

It emphasized the need to phase out cages by 2027 through revised legislation, starting with a revision of Directive 98/58/EC, supported by species-specific approaches, scientific impact assessments, and transition periods to address economic and sanitary challenges. The resolution highlighted the success of the 'End the Cage Age' European Citizens’ Initiative, which garnered 1.4 million signatures, and urged financial support for farmers, including CAP funds and market incentives, to offset higher production costs and prevent market displacement. It called for strict enforcement of EU animal welfare standards on imports, alignment of trade agreements with these standards, and development of cage-free systems such as free-range and organic farming. The Parliament noted progress in some Member States banning cages beyond EU minima and stressed the need for uniform legislation to ensure fair competition, while promoting consumer education, voluntary labeling, and international advocacy for animal welfare.",
