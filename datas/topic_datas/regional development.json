The resolution noted that €5.5 billion from 2007-2013 Cohesion Policy funds were allocated to EE projects, with €3.8 billion (68% implementation rate) utilized by 2011, but flagged uneven progress across Member States. For 2014-2020, it urged simplified access to Structural and Investment Funds for local authorities, prioritized EE in Horizon 2020 research, and advocated leveraging financial instruments like JESSICA and ELENA to attract private investment. It called for integrating EE into smart grids, regional innovation strategies, and national reform programs, while streamlining administrative procedures to enhance fund absorption. The Parliament emphasized balancing EE investments with Cohesion Policy’s core aim of reducing regional disparities, particularly in poorer regions, and urged stricter project selection criteria, transparent indicators, and life-cycle cost assessments to improve cost-effectiveness, as recommended by the Court of Auditors. Additionally, it pressed for Mediterranean and Central European cooperation on EE models and highlighted the need for skills training, public awareness campaigns, and alignment of national EE action plans with operational programs to ensure energy autonomy and affordability.",

It highlighted that removing 20% of existing obstacles could boost GDP by 2% (€91 billion) and create 1 million jobs, emphasizing the need to address legal, linguistic, and regulatory barriers hindering cross-border healthcare, labor mobility (noting 2 million cross-border workers and students), SME growth (SMEs employ 67% of workers and generate 57% of value added), and transport connectivity, including missing railway links. The resolution urged enhanced use of EU tools like European Territorial Cooperation (ETC) and Interreg programs, calling for increased post-2020 funding, simplified procedures, and dedicated CEF budgets for sustainable transport. It stressed multilingual education, mutual recognition of qualifications, e-government interoperability, and cross-border cultural initiatives to foster integration, while advocating tailored approaches for maritime and external borders, including support for outermost regions. The Parliament also emphasized cohesion policy’s role in addressing Brexit impacts, promoting macro-regional strategies, and leveraging cultural and creative industries (CCIs) to drive growth, social cohesion, and tourism. It urged Member States to harmonize legal frameworks, improve emergency services cooperation, and expand cross-border healthcare zones (e.g., ZOAST areas), while highlighting the need for youth engagement, apprenticeships, and measures to combat discrimination and support vulnerable groups. Finally, it called for a European cross-border convention to resolve legal obstacles and enhance territorial impact assessments in EU legislation.",

It highlighted that cohesion policy reprogrammed over 11% of its 2007-2012 budget to address urgent needs, with ESI Funds constituting over 80% of public investment in some Member States during that period. The resolution stressed Article 23 should only be used as a last resort to avoid undermining long-term investment stability, given the multiannual nature of ESI programmes versus the annual European Semester cycle. It called for cautious, transparent application of reprogramming or payment suspensions, ensuring proportionality, territorial specificity (per Articles 174 and 349 TFEU), and minimal administrative burden, while safeguarding employment, social cohesion, and thematic objectives like education and job creation. The Parliament urged the Commission to prioritize dialogue with Member States, conduct impact assessments on unemployment and regional development, and avoid penalizing regions reliant on ESI Funds. It criticized the lack of parliamentary oversight in the Guidelines, demanding formalized procedures for consultation and transparency, including early warnings for reprogramming and detailed reporting on suspended amounts. Additionally, it requested a 2017 review of Article 23’s application, focusing on cost-efficiency and alignment with partnership principles, and stressed the need for institutional coordination to balance economic governance with cohesion policy’s solidarity-driven objectives.",

It urged sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMPs) for all large cities by 2030, prioritizing public transport, cycling infrastructure, and 30 km/h speed limits in residential areas. Addressing digital divides, it stressed universal connectivity, digital literacy, and ethical AI use. Gender equality measures included combating gender-based violence, ratifying the Istanbul Convention, and addressing unpaid care work (80% provided by women). The resolution highlighted the need for multi-level governance, direct EU funding access for cities, and strengthening the European Urban Initiative with €400 million, while advocating 15% of recovery funds for urban post-COVID challenges. It promoted green transitions through renewable energy, circular economies, and urban resilience strategies, alongside support for cultural sectors and youth programs to mitigate pandemic-driven job losses and educational disruptions.",
