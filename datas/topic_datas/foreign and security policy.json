The resolution urged Iran to combat corruption, align with FATF recommendations, and pursue WTO accession to integrate into the global economy, while highlighting concerns over U.S. sanctions impacting EU businesses and advocating euro-based transactions. Human rights concerns included Iran’s high execution rates (noting 86% of global opium seizures occur there), urging abolition of the death penalty for drug offenses (potentially reducing executions by 80%) and minors, and calling for releases of political prisoners and dual nationals. It stressed gender equality, protection of ethnic and religious minorities, and judicial reforms. Regionally, Iran’s role in countering ISIS and stabilizing Iraq/Syria was acknowledged, alongside calls for de-escalation with Saudi Arabia and regional cooperation on security, energy, and refugee management (noting Iran hosts 3 million Afghans). Environmental cooperation on water scarcity, renewable energy (highlighting Iran’s solar potential), and Caspian Sea pollution was encouraged. Educational exchanges, including Erasmus Mundus and Horizon 2020 collaboration, were promoted to foster people-to-people ties. The resolution balanced economic engagement with demands for human rights progress, advocating a \"four Cs\" dialogue (comprehensive, cooperative, critical, constructive) to advance mutual interests while addressing systemic challenges.",

While acknowledging Bangladesh’s legislative efforts and its 2015-2021 National Action Plan to eliminate child marriage, the resolution criticized poor implementation and regression caused by the 2017 law, undermining the government’s own targets to reduce under-15 marriages by 2021 and under-18 marriages by 2041. It urged amendments to close legal loopholes, establish clear judicial criteria involving health professionals and child consent, and resume the National Action Plan with concrete steps. The Parliament also called for gender equality measures, addressing root causes like poverty and lack of education, amending the 2014 Foreign Donations Act to protect NGOs, and ending violence against journalists through independent investigations. It urged the EU to prioritize these issues in dialogues and support Bangladesh’s compliance with international human rights obligations, including the Sustainable Development Goals and conventions on women’s and children’s rights.",

It called for universal ICC ratification, increased funding for the Court, and enhanced cooperation to execute arrest warrants for 13 fugitives. The EU was urged to support investigations into atrocities in Syria, Iraq (including ISIS/Daesh’s genocide against Yazidis and Christians), Nigeria (Boko Haram’s crimes), and Burundi (potential crimes against humanity), including backing the UN’s IIIM for Syria and proposals for an International Criminal Tribunal for Iraq and Syria. The resolution highlighted gender-based violence as a weapon of war, demanding accountability for sexual crimes and women’s inclusion in peace processes. It advocated sanctions against states aiding ISIS/Daesh, arms embargoes on violators of international humanitarian law (IHL), and support for evidence-gathering initiatives like the \"Bringing Daesh to Justice Coalition.\" Member States were urged to adopt universal jurisdiction, strengthen national laws on atrocity crimes, and amend EU treaties to include these crimes under EU competence. The resolution also emphasized transitional justice, victim reparations, and compliance with IHL, while condemning Russia and China’s UN Security Council vetoes blocking ICC referrals. Finally, it called for reforms to prevent conflicts, address root causes, and enhance early-warning systems, alongside training for EU delegations and security forces to detect and prevent atrocities.",

Concerns were highlighted over persistent corruption, political interference in justice, slow court proceedings, and inadequate anti-corruption institutional capacity. The resolution called for finalizing electoral reforms ahead of the 2017 elections, ensuring depoliticized administration, transparency in party financing, and civil society oversight. It emphasized protecting human rights, minority inclusion (notably Roma and ethnic minorities), combating domestic violence, and advancing LGBTI rights, while urging ratification of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. Media independence, addressing self-censorship, and enhancing the Audiovisual Media Authority’s autonomy were flagged, alongside environmental challenges, including poor waste management and risks from hydropower projects, notably on the Vjosa River.

Concerns were expressed over alleged Russian interference, including an attempted coup on 16 October 2016, and calls for thorough investigations. The resolution emphasized persistent challenges in media freedom, including attacks on journalists, smear campaigns, and lack of accountability, urging legal reforms and protection for press independence. It stressed the need for stronger anti-corruption measures, including prosecuting high-level cases, improving whistleblower protections, and addressing money laundering and human trafficking. Social issues highlighted included discrimination against Roma, LGBTI communities, and people with disabilities, gender-based violence, and low female political representation. Economically, Montenegro was urged to reduce its shadow economy, boost SME support, and ensure fiscal sustainability while addressing youth unemployment and improving labor rights. Environmental concerns focused on unsustainable energy projects like the Pljevlja II coal plant, delays in protecting biodiversity (e.g., Ulcinj Salina), and compliance with climate commitments. The Parliament welcomed Montenegro’s alignment with EU foreign policy, NATO accession progress, and regional cooperation, while urging resolution of border disputes and adherence to international refugee standards.

The resolution urged constitutional, electoral, and judicial reforms to ensure non-discrimination, rule of law, and functional governance, stressing the need to address OSCE/ODIHR recommendations and operationalize the Stabilisation and Association Parliamentary Committee (SAPC), stalled for three years due to procedural disputes. It highlighted systemic corruption, weak anti-corruption frameworks, and politicization of public administration, calling for improved judicial independence, prosecution of high-profile cases, and alignment with GRECO recommendations. Human rights concerns included gender inequality, inadequate protections for minorities (notably Roma facing exclusion in education, employment, and housing), and delays in adopting a national human rights strategy. The Parliament emphasized the need for transitional justice, including a law compensating wartime sexual violence victims, resolving over 540,000 landmine-affected areas (2.2% of territory), and addressing 7,000 missing persons cases. Economic challenges included high youth unemployment, migration pressures (with EU allocating €6 million for migration management), and slow environmental reforms, particularly transboundary pollution and non-compliance with energy and climate standards. The resolution urged alignment with EU foreign policy (notably CFSP, at 61% in 2017) and condemned external interference, while supporting EUFOR Althea’s mandate extension. It called for renewed reforms post-elections to advance socio-economic development, public administration efficiency, and EU acquis alignment, stressing conditionality for EU funding and regional cooperation.",

It condemned reports of torture, sexual abuse, and solitary confinement faced by activists, as well as travel bans on their families, and demanded their immediate release alongside access to independent medical care and legal representation. The resolution highlighted Saudi Arabia’s discriminatory legal framework, including the male guardianship system that restricts women’s autonomy in education, employment, travel, and marriage, and urged its abolition. It criticized the misuse of counterterrorism laws to suppress dissent and called for reforms to laws on associations, cybercrime, and press freedom. Despite welcoming the lifting of the driving ban under Vision 2030, the resolution noted contradictions between reforms and ongoing repression, including high execution rates (averaging 126 annually from 2014–2017) and the use of the death penalty for non-violent crimes. It urged Saudi Arabia to ratify key human rights treaties, end child marriages, and criminalize gender-based violence. The EU was called upon to impose an arms embargo, halt exports of surveillance tools used for repression, and prioritize human rights in diplomatic engagements, including demanding accountability for detained activists like Raif Badawi, a Sakharov Prize laureate. The resolution also pressed for unified EU action at the UN, including advocating for a Special Rapporteur on Saudi Arabia and challenging its membership in human rights bodies given its poor record, underscored by its 169th ranking in the 2018 Press Freedom Index.",

Sotoudeh, a 2012 Sakharov Prize laureate, faced a five-year in absentia sentence from 2015 on vague \"espionage\" charges and endured harsh prison conditions, including a hunger strike protesting denial of medical care to fellow detainees. The resolution highlighted Iran’s intensified crackdown on civil society, including women’s rights defenders, environmental activists, and dual nationals, with hundreds jailed in 2018 on broad \"national security\" charges. It condemned Iran’s use of torture, denial of fair trials, and restrictions on legal counsel, as well as discrimination against religious minorities like Baha’i and Christians. The Parliament demanded Sotoudeh’s immediate release, alongside other prisoners of conscience, including her husband Reza Khandan, arrested for advocating her freedom. It urged Iran to abolish the death penalty, particularly for juvenile offenders, and align with international human rights standards, including UN guidelines on prison conditions. The resolution called on the EU to prioritize human rights in dialogues with Iran, enforce restrictive measures until April 2019 targeting entities involved in repression, and support activists through diplomatic missions. It stressed the need for Iran to implement its Citizens’ Rights Charter, ensure religious freedom, and cooperate with UN human rights mechanisms, while expressing solidarity with protests against economic hardship and mandatory hijab laws.",

While condemning all forms of violence against women and girls as a criminal offense, it noted under-reporting of domestic abuse against men, citing 600,000 male victims in England and Wales in 2016 and 20% of cases in Scotland. The resolution highlighted the devastating consequences of such violence, including homelessness (60% of affected women), depression, suicide risks, and adverse maternal and child health outcomes. It urged Member States to uphold gender equality under EU treaties, address disparities in reporting and attitudes across the EU, and collaborate on sharing best practices to prevent violence. The Parliament welcomed the 2014 EU-wide survey on violence against women and called for a similar study on male victims. It acknowledged the signing of the Istanbul Convention by all 28 Member States and ratification by 14, stressing national sovereignty in its implementation. The resolution also recognized the multifaceted nature of gender-based violence, encompassing physical, emotional, sexual, economic, and psychological abuse linked to power dynamics.",

It denounced politically motivated charges against Navalny, including a $350 fine, 15-day imprisonment, and a February 2017 embezzlement verdict deemed unfair by the European Court of Human Rights, which effectively barred him from politics. The resolution highlighted Russia’s introduction of restrictive laws like Article 212.1 criminalizing public assemblies, the rise to 102 political prisoners in 2016, and systemic judicial bias against dissent. It urged Russia to release detainees, cease harassment of activists and journalists, uphold constitutional and international human rights obligations (notably the European Convention on Human Rights), and amend laws contradicting freedom of assembly and expression.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised grave concerns over Russia’s systematic violations of international law, including the illegal annexation of Crimea, military aggression in Eastern Ukraine resulting in over 10,000 deaths, and destabilizing actions in Georgia, Moldova, and the Sea of Azov through militarization and restrictions on navigation. It condemned Russia’s interference in EU democracies via disinformation, cyberattacks, financial support for far-right movements, and attempts to influence elections, including the Brexit referendum. The resolution highlighted severe human rights abuses, including the persecution of Crimean Tatars, crackdowns on dissent, arbitrary detentions (noting 143 political prisoners by March 2018), and systemic repression of LGBTI individuals, journalists, and activists like Oleg Sentsov and Oyub Titiev. It criticized Russia’s non-compliance with over 1,000 European Court of Human Rights rulings, its role in the Skripal poisoning, and obstruction of justice in the MH17 downing. The Parliament demanded sustained EU sanctions until full implementation of the Minsk Agreements, opposed energy dependency projects like Nord Stream 2, and called for a European Magnitsky Act to target individuals involved in corruption and rights abuses. It urged enhanced cybersecurity, stricter anti-money laundering measures to counter Russian illicit financial activities, and increased support for civil society, independent media, and people-to-people exchanges. The resolution emphasized the need for EU unity in diversifying energy supplies, upholding a rules-based international order, and maintaining dialogue on global challenges like climate change and counter-terrorism while conditioning improved relations on Russia’s adherence to international law and democratic principles.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over the persistent issue of statelessness affecting millions globally, particularly in South and Southeast Asia, where over 10 million stateless persons reside, including the Rohingya in Myanmar—the largest stateless group at over 1 million. It highlighted systemic causes such as discriminatory nationality laws (e.g., gender-based discrimination in Brunei, Malaysia, and Nepal), gaps in birth registration (135 million unregistered children under five in the region), and arbitrary deprivation of citizenship. The resolution emphasized the severe human rights violations stemming from statelessness, including denial of education, healthcare, property rights, and political participation, while underscoring its destabilizing effects on development, peace, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It urged Myanmar to restore citizenship to the Rohingya, open Rakhine State to humanitarian aid, and end ethnic violence, while calling on ASEAN and SAARC countries to adopt equitable nationality laws, improve data collection, and implement UNHCR’s 2024 Campaign to End Statelessness. The EU was urged to prioritize statelessness in external action, develop a comprehensive strategy combining urgent humanitarian aid and long-term legal reforms, support SDG 16.9 (legal identity for all), and allocate funding for NGOs and regional cooperation. Positive developments, such as Thailand granting nationality to 23,000 stateless individuals since 2011 and Vietnam’s 2008 naturalization reforms, were noted as models. The resolution stressed ending gender discrimination in nationality laws, ensuring birth registration, and integrating stateless communities into development programs to uphold human rights and democratic stability.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised deep concerns over Moldova’s invalidation of the 2018 Chișinău mayoral election results, where Andrei Nastase won 52.57% of votes but courts annulled the outcome citing social media campaigning post-deadline—a practice previously tolerated. It condemned this decision as politically motivated, undermining democratic principles, judicial independence, and public trust, and warned of authoritarian trends. The resolution highlighted systemic issues, including electoral law changes criticized by OSCE/ODIHR and the Venice Commission for risking undue influence, inadequate minority representation, and lack of consensus. It linked Moldova’s democratic backsliding to failures in judiciary reform, politicized prosecutions, and insufficient progress in investigating the 2014 banking fraud ($1 billion loss), urging asset recovery and accountability. The Parliament demanded suspension of EU macro-financial assistance and budgetary support until Moldova meets political conditions, including credible parliamentary elections and judicial reforms.
