        "stance": "ECR strongly agrees the issue’s emphasis on expanding inland waterways as critical to achieving EU climate targets, aligning with ECR’s priorities for sustainable infrastructure and reduced road dependency.  \nECR proposes enhancing the TEN-T revision process to explicitly integrate Poland’s E70 waterway into the core network, ensuring EU funding access for modernization of locks and navigability in Warmian-Masurian and Podlaskie regions.  \nECR applauds the focus on multimodal hubs and urges accelerated rail connectivity projects at inland ports to unlock regional economic potential, as demonstrated by the untapped tourism-transport synergies of the Masurian Lakes system.  \nECR emphasizes the necessity of a dedicated EU fund with simplified allocation mechanisms to address underinvestment in SMEs and fleet retrofitting, particularly for hydrogen-ready vessels on strategic corridors like the E40 and E30.  \nECR highlights the need to pair digitalization efforts with workforce upskilling programs in autonomous shipping technologies, ensuring competitiveness while safeguarding employment in traditional waterway sectors."

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the need to enhance the role of inland waterway transport (IWT) in achieving EU climate goals, emphasizing its current underutilization (6.1% of freight transport vs. 76.3% for roads) and potential to reduce emissions, congestion, and road dependency. It called for urgent modal shifts through infrastructure investments, including completing the TEN-T core network by 2030 to address bottlenecks and missing links, and expanding digital and physical infrastructure (e.g., locks, bridges, and interoperable RIS). The resolution highlighted climate challenges, such as low water levels causing a €5 billion loss in German industrial production in 2018, and urged action plans to improve navigability and fleet adaptability. It stressed greening the sector via a €10 billion funding gap for decarbonization, promoting alternative fuels (hydrogen, electrification), modular ship retrofitting, and aligning with the EU Hydrogen Strategy. Digitalization and autonomous shipping were prioritized, including harmonizing standards, eFTI implementation, and leveraging EU space programs. Inland ports were identified as multimodal hubs requiring better rail connections, energy infrastructure, and circular economy integration. The resolution advocated for an EU inland waterway fund to support SMEs, fleet modernization, and port upgrades, alongside Horizon Europe and Recovery and Resilience Facility financing. It also emphasized workforce training, social protections, and integrating waterborne transport into urban mobility strategies to boost tourism and last-mile logistics.",

    "background": "The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global trade flows, exposed supply chain vulnerabilities in critical sectors, and intensified debates on EU strategic dependencies. Existing EU sustainability agendas and challenges to multilateral trade governance amid geopolitical tensions framed the context. The Parliament will discuss post-pandemic EU trade policy adaptation, emphasizing sustainability, supply chain resilience, and reforming multilateral frameworks.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic’s severe disruptions to global trade, supply chains, and inequalities, emphasizing the need for resilient, diversified, and sustainable value chains. It stressed the urgency of integrating the European Green Deal and digital strategies into trade policy, including binding sustainability criteria, mandatory due diligence, and alignment with the Paris Agreement and SDGs. The resolution called for reducing strategic dependencies on critical goods like medical supplies and semiconductors through diversification, reshoring, and stockpiling, while promoting circular economy principles and addressing rising greenhouse gas emissions from imports. It urged swift adoption of a digital trade strategy to harmonize regulations, protect data rights, and leverage the EU’s leadership in setting global standards. On multilateralism, Parliament highlighted WTO reform priorities, including reviving the Appellate Body, concluding fisheries subsidies negotiations, and advancing a trade and climate initiative. It demanded equitable global vaccine distribution, support for COVAX, transparency in vaccine pricing, and exploration of a temporary TRIPS waiver to boost production. The resolution emphasized stricter enforcement of trade and sustainable development (TSD) chapters, sanctions for non-compliance, and inclusion of gender, SME, and digital trade provisions in agreements. It opposed ratification of the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment until Chinese sanctions on EU entities are lifted and urged stronger partnerships with Africa, the Indo-Pacific, and the Americas. Key actions included an EU carbon border adjustment mechanism, anti-coercion instruments, and addressing food insecurity exacerbated by the pandemic, noting 265 million people faced acute food shortages in 2020. The resolution also prioritized transatlantic cooperation on tech standards, resolving trade disputes, and advancing a plurilateral WTO agenda.",
