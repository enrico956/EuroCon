    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the inefficiency, high costs, and environmental impact of maintaining three separate workplaces in Strasbourg, Brussels, and Luxembourg, as mandated by Protocol 6 of the EU Treaties. It highlighted annual costs between €156 million and €204 million (10% of its budget) and CO₂ emissions of 11,000–19,000 tonnes due to monthly relocations, with Strasbourg’s buildings unused 89% of the year. Emphasizing its evolution into a co-legislator with increased legislative activity (454 ordinary procedures in 2004–2009 versus 165 in 1993–1999), Parliament argued that its dispersion isolates it from other EU institutions and stakeholders, undermining efficiency and transparency. It noted strong public opposition, including a petition signed by over one million citizens, and a 2012 plenary vote where 78% of MEPs supported revising the seat arrangement. Parliament called for a Treaty revision under Article 48 TEU to amend Article 341 TFEU and Protocol 6, enabling it to determine its own seat and working arrangements. It requested independent analyses of potential savings from a single seat (Brussels) and a Eurobarometer survey by 2014 on citizens’ views, while acknowledging the need for orderly transition and continued use of existing buildings. The resolution stressed the urgency of addressing this issue during the financial crisis and reaffirmed Parliament’s commitment to cost-efficiency, environmental responsibility, and democratic accountability.",

The Parliament urged raising donation limits to €25,000 per donor annually (with transparency safeguards), allowing parties to engage in EU-related referendum campaigns, and encouraging direct individual membership. It stressed the need for sanctions for funding violations and requested the Commission to propose a tailored Financial Regulation title for party funding, alongside transnational electoral reforms.

It acknowledged differentiated integration as an existing reality, encompassing multispeed approaches, variable geometry, and à la carte mechanisms, but stressed it must remain temporary, open to all Member States, and aligned with Treaty provisions (Articles 20 and 46 TEU) to prevent creating first- and second-class members. The resolution called for shifting Council voting from unanimity to qualified majority voting via the passerelle clause (Article 48(7) TEU) to overcome deadlocks, particularly in taxation and economic governance, and highlighted Brexit as an opportunity to transition from opt-out to non-discriminatory opt-in models. It urged integrating initiatives like the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) into the EU legal framework, completing the Banking Union with a fiscal backstop, and establishing a Euro Area budget line. The Parliament emphasized democratic accountability, opposing intergovernmental structures that reduce transparency, and demanded strengthened parliamentary oversight over EU expenditure, including enhanced cooperation activities. It advocated ending permanent opt-outs in primary law, allowing only temporary, case-by-case transitional periods for new members, and proposed partnerships for non-EU states adhering to EU values and contributing to the budget. Core EU policies on fundamental rights, economic cohesion, and environmental standards were deemed non-negotiable, with differentiation prohibited in areas risking negative externalities like social dumping. The resolution also promoted regional cooperation, cross-border initiatives, and rationalizing budgetary tools to support convergence, while urging the Commission to enforce single market rules and accelerate socio-economic integration.",

Lobbying rules were tightened, including badge removal for non-compliance and banning entourage badges for lobbying. Procedural reforms streamlined voting sequences, limited written questions to 20 per MEP every three months (addressing over 60,000 annual submissions), capped motions for resolutions to one per member monthly, restricted roll-call votes to 100 per group per session, and proposed abolishing written declarations or requiring 40 MEPs from three groups to table them. Thresholds for initiatives were set at one-twentieth, one-tenth, or one-fifth of Parliament’s membership. Intergroups were required to operate transparently, and committees gained authority to accelerate priority legislation.

It stressed transparency in legislative procedures, advocating for second-reading agreements as the standard and cautioning against non-transparent first-reading negotiations. The agreement also promotes cooperation with national parliaments on subsidiarity checks, flexibility in enforcing the eight-week deadline for reasoned opinions, and improved political dialogue. The Parliament highlighted the importance of evaluating the new IIA’s impact on existing agreements, ensuring compliance with deadlines, and adapting its Rules of Procedure to reflect the agreement. Specific operational details included timelines for objections to delegated acts (two months, extendable by two months) and urgency procedures for crises, alongside requirements for Commission consultations with Member State experts and stakeholders during delegated act preparation.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the need to modernize the role and operational framework of the European Ombudsman by adopting a new regulation to replace the outdated 1994 Decision, aligning it with post-Lisbon Treaty legal standards. The regulation strengthens the Ombudsman’s mandate to investigate maladministration in EU institutions, bodies, and agencies (excluding the Court of Justice in its judicial role), emphasizing the right to good administration under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. It grants the Ombudsman authority to conduct own-initiative inquiries to address systemic issues, follow up on compliance with recommendations, and submit annual reports to Parliament assessing institutional compliance and resource adequacy. Complaints must be filed within three years of the complainant becoming aware of the issue, after exhausting administrative remedies, and can remain confidential. The Ombudsman has broad access to information, including classified documents, subject to confidentiality agreements, and must notify relevant authorities (e.g., the European Public Prosecutor’s Office) of potential criminal matters while respecting due process rights. Institutions are required to respond to inquiries within three months (extendable by two months) and cooperate fully, with non-compliance reported to Parliament. The Ombudsman’s independence is safeguarded through appointment by Parliament for the parliamentary term, with qualifications mirroring judicial standards, and a budget ensuring operational autonomy. The regulation also mandates cooperation with national ombudsmen and EU bodies like the Fundamental Rights Agency, while ensuring staff confidentiality and procedural safeguards for handling sensitive data.",

The resolution noted challenges, including lengthy procedures due to unclear timelines, lack of operational guidelines, and reliance on intergovernmental agreements outside EU frameworks (e.g., the Fiscal Compact), which undermine legal consistency and democratic scrutiny.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns and proposed reforms to enhance the transparency, efficiency, and democratic role of European political parties and foundations under Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014. It emphasized the need for these entities to promote EU values, foster citizen engagement, and strengthen the European public sphere, while addressing obstacles such as administrative burdens, restrictive funding rules, and insufficient visibility. Key issues included inadequate compliance with logo display requirements by national member parties (only 15% met standards), overly narrow revenue categories, and the need to lower the co-financing rate for parties from 10% to 5% to align with foundations. The resolution advocated allowing financing of EU-related referendum campaigns, expanding permissible activities, and revising membership criteria to include parties from non-EU European countries and direct citizen participation. It called for harmonizing rules to reduce legal uncertainty, abolishing redundant financial reporting standards (e.g., International Financial Reporting Standards), and extending carry-over periods for foundations to N+1. Transparency measures included stricter scrutiny of donations exceeding €3,000, public disclosure of financial statements, and preventing circumvention of donation limits by 2027. The Parliament urged strengthening the Authority’s capacity to enforce compliance with EU values, proposed vote-based funding to boost electoral engagement, and demanded a single legal framework to consolidate rules on registration, financing, and governance. It also highlighted the need for clearer EU legal status for parties to avoid classification as foreign entities under national laws and emphasized democratic internal structures aligned with Article 2 TEU values. The Commission was urged to incorporate these proposals in its upcoming legislative review to enhance accountability, inclusivity, and the pan-European political landscape.",
