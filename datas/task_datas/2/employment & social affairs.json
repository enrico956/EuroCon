It emphasized the need for Member States to conduct social impact assessments of austerity policies, prioritize preventive healthcare, and invest in social services to address systemic barriers, such as high out-of-pocket costs, institutional care over community-based support, and gaps in maternal and neonatal care (10% of EU births are premature). The resolution called for reforms to ensure universal, equitable access to quality healthcare, including free vaccinations, sexual and reproductive health services, and targeted support for informal carers (78% women), whose contributions should be recognized in pension eligibility. It urged leveraging EU funds like the European Social Fund to strengthen social protection systems, improve health literacy, and combat discrimination, while promoting gender equality (18% pay gap) and decent working conditions in the care sector. The Parliament stressed alignment with the Europe 2020 poverty reduction target, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the need for robust data collection to monitor progress, warning that austerity-driven cuts risk long-term public health and economic stability.",

It highlighted the undervalued and informal nature of domestic work, which constitutes 5-9% of employment in industrialized countries, predominantly employing women under precarious, underpaid conditions with risks of discrimination, abuse, and limited access to rights, particularly for migrant workers facing multiple vulnerabilities. The resolution strongly supported the ILO Convention on Domestic Workers (2011), urging EU Member States to adopt, ratify, and implement it to ensure legal recognition of domestic work, extend core labor standards, social security, non-discrimination, health and safety protections, maternity rights, and address gender and ethnic pay gaps. It called for transforming informal care roles into decent jobs through accessible childcare/elderly-care facilities, regularization campaigns, and model contracts, while emphasizing the need to combat undeclared work and labor market segmentation. The resolution advocated for inclusive policies to protect migrant workers, including ratification of the UN Migrant Workers Convention, and stressed adapting legislation to ensure flexible, secure contracts and equal treatment, particularly for vulnerable groups affected by atypical employment and systemic inequalities.",

It noted the 2017 EU employment rate of 73.2% for those aged 20-64, nearing the Europe 2020 target of 75%, but highlighted persistent challenges, including a youth unemployment rate of 18.6%, with NEETs costing €153 billion annually compared to the €21 billion Youth Guarantee budget (2017-2020). The resolution underscored rising precarious work, with part-time employment increasing from 16.8% to 18.7% (2008-2017), and in-work poverty at 9.6%, disproportionately affecting women. Despite a slight decline, 22.5% of the population remained at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE), with child poverty rates higher in single-parent households. Gender gaps persisted, including a 12% employment gap, 16% pay gap, and 37% pension gap, exacerbated by women’s disproportionate care responsibilities (75% of unpaid care work). The resolution called for enhanced social protection, investment in affordable childcare, healthcare, and education, and urged Member States to address housing exclusion, with overcrowding rates exceeding the EU average in ten countries. It stressed the need for climate action, including decarbonization investments, and advocated integrating gender mainstreaming into economic policies, such as through gender budgeting and the Gender Equality Index. Other priorities included reducing skills mismatches (40% of adults lack basic digital skills), supporting SMEs, ensuring fair taxation, and improving work-life balance via accessible care services and the adoption of relevant directives. The resolution emphasized the European Semester’s role in promoting social convergence, sustainable growth, and upward economic mobility while tackling inequalities through structural reforms and targeted social investments.",

The resolution stressed modernizing vocational education and training (VET) systems, expanding apprenticeships with fair remuneration, and leveraging the Pact for Skills to support sectors hit by COVID-19. It underscored gender disparities, noting women constitute only 17% of ICT professionals and 36% of STEM graduates, and called for inclusive access to training for vulnerable groups, including low-skilled adults, people with disabilities, and minorities. The Parliament urged increased funding through EU programs like Erasmus+, ESF+, and the Just Transition Fund, alongside national investments, to address inequalities in education access, digital infrastructure, and workforce transitions. It emphasized recognizing informal skills, integrating green and digital competencies into curricula, and ensuring lifelong learning, particularly for older workers, while advocating for paid educational leave and robust teacher upskilling. The resolution also highlighted the need to reduce early school leaving (10.2% of 18-24-year-olds) and close the digital divide, with 72% of EU teachers being women and 58% of citizens possessing basic digital skills in 2019.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the critical role of vocational education and training (VET) in addressing labor market challenges, fostering social inclusion, and supporting the green and digital transitions. It emphasized the need to modernize VET systems to be inclusive, resilient, and responsive to evolving skills demands, particularly in light of COVID-19 disruptions that exacerbated inequalities, reduced apprenticeship opportunities, and increased youth unemployment (17.6% in the EU by August 2020). The resolution highlighted quantitative targets: by 2025, at least 82% of VET graduates should be employed, 60% should engage in work-based learning, and 8% should participate in international mobility. It called for enhanced digital infrastructure, equitable access to e-learning tools, and support for vulnerable groups, rural areas, and low-skilled adults (60 million in the EU). The Parliament urged alignment with the European Skills Agenda, Digital Education Action Plan, and European Green Deal, stressing the integration of green and digital competencies into curricula. It advocated for stronger synergies between Erasmus+ and the European Social Fund+ to expand mobility programs like ErasmusPro, and endorsed the creation of EU-wide platforms for VET resources, job opportunities, and micro-credentials. The resolution emphasized quality apprenticeships with fair remuneration, gender equality in STEM and green sectors, and the role of Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVEs) in driving innovation. It also highlighted the need for skills anticipation systems, lifelong learning, and paid educational leave to address skills gaps and support labor market transitions, while urging increased funding and cooperation among Member States, social partners, and stakeholders to ensure VET’s adaptability and attractiveness.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the inadequacy of the EU list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions in effectively combating global tax avoidance, which costs an estimated USD 500 billion annually and deprives the EU of 20% of its corporate tax revenue due to profit shifting. While acknowledging the list’s positive impact—such as prompting over 135 countries to engage in tax reforms and leading to revisions of 120 harmful tax practices—it criticized the list’s limited scope, noting jurisdictions on it account for less than 2% of global tax losses, with the Cayman Islands alone responsible for USD 70 billion annually despite being removed in 2020. The resolution called for stricter, transparent, and impartial criteria, including standalone assessments for jurisdictions with 0% corporate tax rates, enhanced substance requirements, and alignment with OECD/G20 BEPS standards, particularly Pillar II on minimum taxation. It urged reforms to the listing process, advocating a legally binding framework, greater parliamentary oversight, and public disclosure of assessments, commitments, and correspondence with third countries. The Parliament emphasized the need to hold EU Member States to the same standards, citing instances of aggressive tax planning within the EU, and demanded coordinated defensive measures—such as non-deductibility of costs, withholding taxes, and procurement restrictions—against non-compliant jurisdictions. It also highlighted the importance of fairness in assessing developing countries and major trading partners like the US and post-Brexit UK, while warning against detrimental impacts of aid cuts on vulnerable populations. Overall, the resolution stressed the urgency of strengthening the list’s credibility, transparency, and enforcement to align with global tax justice goals and public demand for robust anti-avoidance measures.",
