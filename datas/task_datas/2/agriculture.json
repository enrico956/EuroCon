It highlighted risks of egg shortages, price hikes, and increased imports from countries with lower welfare standards, calling for consumer awareness campaigns, dissuasive sanctions for non-compliant producers, and enhanced Food and Veterinary Office inspections.

Member States were urged to enforce stricter land transaction checks, combat tax evasion, and align policies with the UN’s Voluntary Guidelines on land governance. The resolution emphasized protecting farmland as a public good, ensuring food security, and addressing intergenerational equity, noting challenges for young farmers due to high land prices and inheritance rules.",

It advocated for legal certainty by ensuring payment entitlements allocated before 1 January 2020 remain valid under the 2021–2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and by safeguarding sectoral programs to protect producers. The resolution called for extended transitional support for areas with natural constraints facing new eligibility criteria, allowing continued aid during adaptation. It introduced a 20% loss threshold for risk management compensation to align with updated risk tools and stressed the need for increased technical assistance funding (up to 6% of rural development allocations) to help Member States meet CAP objectives. Additionally, it proposed reinforcing the agricultural crisis reserve as a separate budget line within the MFF, enabling carryover of unspent funds. Financial flexibility measures included permitting precautionary savings schemes for farmers without state aid restrictions and fiscal adjustments for income stabilization. Sector-specific provisions extended self-regulation mechanisms, akin to those in the wine sector, to olive oil producers and supported continuity of national programs for wine and olive oil. Transitional rules were also outlined to honor long-term rural development commitments, such as afforestation projects from pre-2014 programs, ensuring uninterrupted support.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised its position on the Commission’s proposal for a regulation concerning the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) post-2020, emphasizing continuity of current rural development programs, rejecting proposed cuts to the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) in the 2021–2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), and safeguarding sectoral programs to ensure legal certainty for producers. Key amendments included provisions allowing Member States to maintain or increase co-financing for environmental measures, extend transitional support for long-term rural development commitments (e.g., afforestation projects from 2004–2006), and ensure uninterrupted payments for farmers in areas with natural constraints during the transition to new eligibility criteria. The resolution introduced a 20% loss threshold for risk management compensation, prioritized technical assistance funding for Member States to implement CAP reforms, and mandated that the agricultural crisis reserve for 2021–2027 be funded separately from the CAP budget, with unspent amounts carried over annually. It also proposed sector-specific measures, such as extending self-regulation mechanisms from the wine sector to olive oil producers and enabling precautionary savings schemes for farmers without triggering state aid rules. Additionally, the Parliament called for fiscal flexibility to address income variability, including multiannual tax adjustments and exemptions for dedicated savings accounts, while instructing the Commission to resubmit the proposal if substantially amended.",
