It welcomed the €10 billion capital increase approved in 2012, enabling an additional €60 billion in EU lending (a 49% expansion) for 2013-2015, aiming to unlock €180 billion in investments, particularly for SMEs, infrastructure, innovation, and low-carbon initiatives under the Europe 2020 strategy. Concerns were highlighted over low EIB lending in crisis-hit Programme Countries (e.g., Greece, Ireland), where 2013 targets reached only €5 billion (8% of total EU lending), and the Bank’s risk-averse approach, urging enhanced risk-taking and transparency. The resolution emphasized boosting SME financing, citing 2013 targets of €19 billion for SMEs and mid-caps, alongside blended instruments like the Growth and Employment Facility and Project Bond Initiative (supported by €230 million from the EU budget), which approved nine infrastructure projects. Climate priorities were stressed, including the EIB’s new Emissions Performance Standard for fossil fuels and demands for a phase-out plan for non-renewable energy lending. Youth employment programs, such as the €6 billion Youth Employment Initiative, were noted, alongside calls for improved governance, compliance with anti-tax evasion standards, and cooperation with institutions like the EBRD and World Bank (jointly committing €30 billion for 2013-2014). The Parliament urged stricter oversight of financial intermediaries, enhanced transparency in project selection, and regular reporting on employment impacts and alignment with EU external policies, while safeguarding the EIB’s triple-A rating to maintain cost-effective market access.",

It acknowledged the release of €2 million from this reserve for IT development and infrastructure projects after EFSA fulfilled conditions by submitting a staff opinion survey, while the remaining reserve funds were reallocated to address the H1N1 pandemic, though EFSA postponed recruitment plans using these funds to 2010. The Parliament noted €6 million in canceled payment appropriations due to EFSA’s introduction of differentiated appropriations for science grants and cooperation projects, urging improved budget planning and monitoring. It emphasized the need for EFSA to maintain high-quality, independent scientific advice to uphold EU safety standards, recommending stricter enforcement of internal rules on declarations of interest for staff and experts. Despite these observations, the Parliament granted discharge to EFSA’s Executive Director for the 2009 budget and approved the closure of the accounts, concluding that the Authority’s financial management met requirements for accountability.",

It acknowledged the ETF’s commitment to stricter interpretation of the Financial Regulation, tighter monitoring of transfers, and corrective measures to address these issues.

It highlighted the Council’s 85.7% budget implementation rate and low post-occupancy rates (90% in 2008) as areas needing improvement. The Parliament insisted on enhanced transparency for CFSP expenditures, detailed breakdowns of special representatives’ mission costs, and compliance with audit recommendations, urging the Council to provide required documents by 1 June 2010, including governance plans for major projects and reforms to ensure public accountability. It also called for formalizing annual consultations between the Council and Parliament to improve budgetary oversight and align discharge procedures with other EU institutions.",

However, it criticized the carry-over of €16.2 million (40% of the budget), which undermined the principle of annuality and indicated weaknesses in budget planning. The Parliament noted excessive cash reserves of €16.7 million at year-end, generating €313,000 in interest, with €307,000 returned to the Commission, urging stricter adherence to needs-based cash management. Recruitment delays were flagged, with only 101 of 130 authorized posts filled by 2008, and 16 recruitment processes requiring re-advertisement. Concerns persisted over unresolved seat negotiations with Sweden, including unregulated renovation expenses of €500,000, though progress on personal identity number agreements was acknowledged. The ECDC was faulted for incomplete reporting on internal audits, with six critical recommendations pending, including gaps in scientific advice protocols and financial control standards. The resolution called for improved budget execution, recruitment efficiency, and compliance with procurement rules, while recognizing efforts to enhance organizational structure and operational capacity.",

It criticized non-compliance with the Financial Regulation in six cases where budget commitments followed legal obligations, urging adherence. The resolution highlighted necessary revisions to the ITER Financial Regulation, including exceptions to budgetary principles, internal audit alignment, and grant award rules. It urged timely submission of annual activity reports, improved IT risk documentation, and analysis, while noting progress in internal controls, including an internal audit action plan and appointments of a Data Protection Officer. Concerns were raised over high cash holdings (€58.98 million at year-end 2008, generating €216,304.89 in interest), prompting a call for needs-based cash management to minimize reserves. The Parliament approved the closure of the 2008 accounts and granted discharge to the Director, acknowledging the Court of Auditors’ assurance of reliability and legality while emphasizing ongoing operational improvements.",

The Agency received €44.3 million in commitment appropriations and €46.89 million in payment appropriations but faced criticism for 52 budget transfers in 2008 (compared to 32 in 2007), including over €2 million reallocated from personnel to administrative expenses, which affected carry-forwards and repayments. The resolution noted recurring legal commitments made before budgetary authorization, demanding enhanced training and transparency.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over the 2010 EU budget’s implementation, noting the Court of Auditors’ finding that payments were free from material error but highlighted quantifiable eligibility errors in intermediate and final expenditure, alongside non-quantifiable risks in procurement and contract extensions, which remain vulnerable to fraud. It stressed the need for improved oversight in External Action/Development/Enlargement policies, where control systems were deemed partially effective, urging the Commission and EEAS to enhance payment regularity and rigorously monitor risks in budget support, including fraud and corruption. While acknowledging inherent risks in external aid, Parliament called for systematic cost/benefit evaluations of interventions, balanced with strategic EU interests, and emphasized donor coordination with Member States and international organizations. In cohesion policy, 18% of expenditure (€10.8 billion commitments, €7.1 billion payments via the European Social Fund) faced a 7.7% error rate, driven by procurement non-compliance; Member States were urged to improve fund management, with scrutiny of financial engineering instruments and support for the Globalisation Fund’s €105 million in projects. Environmental and climate actions achieved 99.26% execution (€240 million for LIFE+ grants), while public health saw 99.7% commitment execution but delays in payments. Parliament criticized customs and VAT evasion vulnerabilities, advocating simplified procurement rules and stronger consumer protection mechanisms, including SOLVIT and the European Consumer Centres. Regional policy disbursed €30.557 billion, with 49% of audited payments error-prone (mainly procurement and eligibility issues), urging simplification and stricter controls. Gender-responsive budgeting was lacking, and Parliament demanded audits assessing gender impacts. Lastly, it highlighted mismanagement in education/culture programs and the abrupt closure of a pan-European TV project without parliamentary consent, demanding transparency. Overall, the resolution underscored the need for enhanced accountability, error reduction, and strategic alignment with EU priorities.",

It noted the Court of Auditors’ findings that 2011 payments under budget heading 4 (external relations) were free from material error, but interim and final payments elsewhere faced material errors, including ineligible costs and procurement violations. The resolution urged strengthened controls, particularly for external aid, where risks of irregularity and fraud persist, and called for clearer benchmarks to measure policy impacts. It highlighted a 2.2% error rate in Employment and Social Affairs (below the 3.9% average), though €2.7 billion in unpaid ESF benefits due to insufficient appropriations underscored funding gaps. In environment and climate action, 99.92% of commitments were executed, with LIFE+ allocating €267 million to projects, but DG CLIMA’s payment rate lagged at 58.23%. Transport policy saw high implementation rates (99.85% commitments, 97.03% payments), though TEN-T funding cuts and safety program underspending were criticized. Cohesion policy remained error-prone, with 98 ERDF/Cohesion Fund and 70 ESF payments audited in 2011 containing errors, driven by procurement breaches. Fisheries faced rising error rates, overcapacity from public aid, and flawed fleet register data, while maritime funds achieved 97% commitment execution. Education and culture agencies were praised for procedural simplification but faulted for Lifelong Learning Programme errors. Gender budgeting was demanded to assess equality impacts, with calls for gender-specific data in budget reporting. The resolution stressed corrective measures across sectors, including risk-based controls, streamlined procurement, and enhanced transparency in election mission costs, while supporting discharge for 2011 expenditures in environment, health, fisheries, and transport despite persistent challenges.",

It pushed for enhanced performance audits, clearer timelines for Special Reports (noting a reduction from 25 to 20 months since 2008 but expressing regret over unmet 18-month targets), and stricter adherence to deadlines for preliminary findings. The resolution highlighted concerns over translation cost disparities per language and urged alignment with other institutions’ methodologies. It commended the Court’s anti-fraud cooperation with OLAF, citing eight audit-related fraud cases and eight denunciation cases in 2012, leading to nine investigations, and called for detailed reporting on closed OLAF cases. The Parliament also addressed a 2012 harassment case involving a former Court member, urging procedural reviews to safeguard workplace dignity, and welcomed the new Code of Conduct for Court members while advocating a two-term limit for the Court President. Finally, it requested updates on internal audit verifications, human resources allowances, and follow-up actions on Parliament’s recommendations in future reports.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised key points regarding the 2012 financial management of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), approving the closure of its accounts and granting discharge to its Executive Director. The Authority’s 2012 budget was €78.3 million (0.056% of the EU budget), with a 99.3% implementation rate and 88% payment execution. It achieved savings of €3.94 million from relocation, reallocated to scientific activities and staff recruitment. While the Court of Auditors found the accounts reliable, it highlighted risks in accounting system validations (excluding local systems) and high carry-over rates for Titles II (22%, €2.3 million) and III (30%, €5.6 million), urging adherence to annuality principles. EFSA improved conflict-of-interest policies, including post-employment restrictions and a 2011 independence policy, but faced criticism for burdensome procedures, insufficient transparency in expert declarations (e.g., anonymized interests like “private company”), and laxer rules for experts from food safety organizations (FSOs) with potential private funding. Parliament called for stricter cooling-off periods (two years for agrifood sector ties), clearer remuneration disclosures, and exclusion of FSOs with over 50% non-public funding. Staffing improved, with 342 of 355 posts filled and 124 contract agents, while 70% of resources focused on scientific activities. Concerns included the Management Board’s refusal to elect leaders via open ballot and risks in internal controls (data management, IT security). EFSA was urged to enhance public communication, transparency, and structured dialogue with civil society, while addressing audit recommendations on accounting validations and carry-overs.",

The Court of Auditors confirmed the accounts’ regularity but noted an irregularity of €0.8 million due to a delayed contract signing, prompting EMSA to introduce annual budget analysis procedures to prevent recurrence. The Court also flagged unreliable controls over internally created intangible assets, though corrective measures were taken. Parliament emphasized EMSA’s expanded role under its 2013 regulation, stressing the need for adequate resources while urging efficient use of funds, avoidance of duplication with national authorities, and cost-effective administrative structures. Governance improvements were acknowledged, including conflict-of-interest policies for inspections (2012) and the Administrative Board (2013), alongside enhanced recruitment transparency. However, Parliament called for urgent publication of CVs and declarations of interest for senior management and board members to bolster transparency.

It noted a 99.9% utilization rate for commitment appropriations and 94.5% for payments after budget reductions, though without adjustments, payment utilization would have been 71%. Of €1.44 billion in operational commitments, 55.4% were directly implemented, with the remainder delayed due to complex contracts. A high cash balance of €51.8 million (14% of payments) raised efficiency concerns. Internal controls remained incomplete despite progress, and audits detected errors in 1.3% of audited claims (€8.3 million). Transparency gaps included unpublished CVs of management members, prompting calls for urgent disclosure and conflict-of-interest safeguards. Procurement risks were flagged, with limited competition in specialized grants, urging action to enhance value-for-money principles. The ITER project’s construction costs, revised to €6.6 billion in 2008, faced risks of €290 million (4.4%) in overruns due to scope changes, with delays necessitating a revised schedule. Parliament highlighted broader issues across EU Research Joint Undertakings, citing €21.8 billion in total resources, SME involvement (21% of JTI funding), and €11.5 billion in EU contributions. It urged the Court of Auditors to analyze risks and efficiency in these entities, emphasizing reputational and financial accountability.",

It noted improvements in financial management, including reduced carry-over cancellations (€34,865, 1.79% of total carry-overs) and praised EIGE’s performance, such as fulfilling 98.75% of its programming activities, releasing the Gender Equality Index, expanding communication outreach, and contributing gender perspectives to EU policies like the Anti-Trafficking Directive. However, concerns were raised over a gender imbalance in the management board (26 female, 6 male members), legal challenges from procurement procedures (€700,000 in potential damages, 9% of the budget), and delays in adopting e-procurement tools. The resolution urged EIGE to address these issues, enhance transparency, and report on progress, while commending its zero-tolerance policy on harassment, internal audit improvements, and cooperation with parliamentary committees. It called for increased funding and staffing to bolster gender mainstreaming efforts and highlighted EIGE’s role in advancing gender equality through projects on work-life balance, pay gaps, and digitalization.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised key observations on the European Ombudsman’s 2014 budget implementation, granting discharge while highlighting administrative and operational aspects. It noted the Ombudsman’s total budget of €9,857,002 (with €7.98 million for staff, €1.35 million for operational costs, and €532,500 for special functions), a 97.87% commitment rate and 93.96% payment rate, though utilization slightly decreased from 2013. The Court of Auditors found no significant weaknesses in human resources or procurement, affirming payments were free from material error. The resolution welcomed the Ombudsman’s systemic approach through own-initiative inquiries and the creation of a dedicated coordinator role but urged regular reporting on their impact. It flagged underperformance in key performance indicators, including slower case closures (12- and 18-month targets) and delayed admissibility decisions, urging mitigation strategies. Concerns included high complaints outside the Ombudsman’s mandate (notably from Spain and Poland), calling for improved communication and cooperation with national ombudsmen. Staff satisfaction dipped in 2014 due to organizational changes, though corrective measures were taken. The resolution criticized excessive travel (212 missions costing €186,000 total) and urged greater use of videoconferencing to reduce costs and CO2 emissions. Recruitment practices faced scrutiny for bypassing standard procedures in hiring three temporary staff, demanding alignment with EU civil service standards. Gender imbalances persisted in AST posts (21 men vs. 9 women) and management (9 men vs. 2 women), requiring medium-term targets. Transparency improvements were sought, including detailed HR breakdowns by nationality and gender, disclosure of OLAF investigation outcomes, and unused interpretation rates. Savings on translation and publications were welcomed, while potential €195,000 savings from a single seat were noted, urging inclusion in Parliament’s centralization debates. The Ombudsman was urged to enhance annual activity report consistency and comprehensiveness as a critical accountability tool.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised key points regarding the European Banking Authority’s (EBA) 2014 financial management, approving the closure of its accounts and granting discharge while highlighting substantive observations. The EBA’s 2014 budget was €33.6 million, a 29.39% increase from 2013, financed by EU (40%) and Member State (60%) contributions. The Court of Auditors confirmed the accounts’ reliability and transaction legality, with a 99.81% budget implementation rate and 83.94% payment execution rate. Carryovers decreased to 15.90%, driven by improved IT contract alignment and reduced infrastructure-related commitments. Staffing stood at 146 posts, prioritizing core functions (4:1 operational-to-administrative ratio). The Parliament noted unresolved transparency issues, including delayed communication of technical standards and leaks of documents, urging stricter conflict-of-interest management and enhanced stakeholder meeting transparency. It criticized EBA’s reliance on national contributions as a threat to independence, advocating a Union-funded model via market participant fees. Concerns over resource adequacy from the Court’s 2014 special report were acknowledged, stressing that expanded mandates require proportional staffing and funding. The resolution emphasized EBA’s technical role in financial stability, consumer protection, and market integration, while cautioning against overstepping its legislative mandate and urging clearer communication with Parliament on prudential standards and methodologies.",

The resolution highlighted underpayments of €128,735 to 20 staff members (2005–2014), resolved via collaboration with the Commission’s Paymaster Office, and praised Eurofound’s new recruitment system and staff allocation (72.81% operational roles, 15.54% administrative). Transparency concerns were raised, as only half of Governing Board members’ CVs and conflict-of-interest declarations were publicly accessible, urging full disclosure. Internal control improvements, including seminars and audits, were noted, alongside the 2015 signing of a long-delayed headquarters agreement with Ireland. Eurofound’s substantive work was commended, including its three flagship surveys (Quality of Life, Working Conditions, and Company Surveys), research on youth unemployment, crisis impacts, and key reports like “Psychosocial Risks in Europe” and “Social Cohesion and Well-being in the EU,” which informed EU policy. The Parliament emphasized Eurofound’s role in evidence-based policymaking and its high recognition in EU social and labor research.",

While the annual accounts were deemed reliable, the resolution highlighted progress in addressing audit deficiencies, including enhanced ex-post audit strategies, assessments covering 54% of grants (aiming for 84%), and a residual error rate of 0.66% (below the 2% threshold). Member States’ contributions fell short of the required 1.8:1 ratio to EU funding, but private sector contributions compensated, covering 65% of costs. The resolution approved the closure of 2013 accounts and acknowledged the merger with ARTEMIS into the ECSEL Joint Undertaking, which began operations in 2014. It emphasized the need for full assessment of national assurance systems and compliance with FP7 monitoring, citing high research productivity (211.5 publications and 16.6 patents per €10 million EU grants). The Commission was urged to evaluate ENIAC’s activities up to the merger for future discharge decisions.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns regarding the implementation of the eighth, ninth, and tenth European Development Funds (EDFs) for 2013, granting discharge to the Commission while highlighting critical findings from the Court of Auditors. It noted a 3.4% error rate in EDF payments, slightly higher than 2012’s 3%, with 27% of tested transactions (45 out of 165) affected by errors, primarily due to inadequate documentation, procurement non-compliance, and ineligible expenses. Despite recoveries increasing to €4.7 million in 2013 (from €1.3 million in 2012), systemic weaknesses persisted, including failures to recover interest on pre-financing above €750,000 and incomplete IT systems for tracking smaller pre-financing. The resolution urged stricter controls, particularly for budget support (€718 million disbursed in 2013), emphasizing corruption risks and the need for binding performance indicators, parliamentary oversight, and anti-corruption measures in partner countries. It criticized the lack of traceability of EU funds in pooled budgets and called for integrating the EDF into the EU budget to enhance transparency and democratic scrutiny. The 11th EDF’s €27 billion allocation (2011 prices) was noted, reflecting frozen funding levels despite calls for increases. Concerns were raised about fragile states like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Haiti, stressing the need for targeted aid, disaster resilience, and governance reforms. The Parliament also demanded improved oversight of the European Investment Bank’s Investment Facility, stricter criteria for financial intermediaries, and better alignment of blending mechanisms with development goals. Overall, it urged the Commission to reduce error rates below 2%, strengthen audit systems, and prioritize results-oriented monitoring to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda.",

It highlighted structural challenges, including a disproportionate number of high-grade posts, a top-heavy managerial hierarchy requiring reform, and the absence of competency frameworks for managerial evaluations, stressing foreign affairs expertise as a key hiring criterion. Geographical and gender imbalances in staffing, particularly in AD grades and leadership roles, alongside overreliance on seconded national experts, were noted as unresolved issues. The resolution urged cost-saving measures through enhanced EU Member State cooperation in foreign policy, co-location of EU delegations with national diplomatic services, shared administrative services, and exploring consular services via EU delegations, pending financial and legislative analysis. It criticized administrative burdens on delegation heads due to financial regulations, dual budget lines complicating expenditures, and delays in establishing a Shared Services Centre to centralize support for CSDP missions and procurement. Concerns were raised about staffing shortages in political sections and operational planning for missions, insufficient integration of external policy dimensions into internal EU policies, and the need for thematic divisions (e.g., conflict prevention, human rights) to be involved in programming from inception. The Parliament reiterated calls to integrate EU Special Representatives into the EEAS for budgetary efficiency and policy coherence and to reduce travel costs through videoconferencing for training and recruitment.",

The Agency’s 2013 budget totaled €167 million (a 5.15% increase from 2012), with €35.8 million from the EU (0.2% rise) and €116.3 million from fees and other sources, achieving a 98% implementation rate. While carry-overs decreased to €7.2 million (8% of the budget), operational expenditure (Title III) retained a high 42% carry-over, partly justified by multiannual projects. Concerns were raised over transparency in outsourcing €22 million of certification activities and low-value contracts, urging clearer documentation. The Agency improved conflict-of-interest management by publishing CVs and declarations of interests for senior staff online. Parliament criticized the 14-year delay in finalizing a headquarters agreement with the host member state (Germany), essential for legal clarity, and urged swift resolution, citing the 2011 precedent of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. It stressed the need for enhanced resources if EASA’s role expands under Single European Sky reforms and called for differentiated staffing rules to exempt industry-funded personnel from EU budget cuts. Internal audits noted progress, with 22 of 23 prior recommendations addressed, but flagged two critical IT management issues. The resolution also emphasized compliance with budgetary annuality and urged revising EASA’s code of conduct to prevent conflicts of interest.",

While acknowledging improvements in reducing carry-overs (from 23% in 2008 to 11% in 2013) and high operational execution (96.99% under Title III), it urged stricter budget monitoring. The resolution highlighted deficiencies in conflict-of-interest management, criticizing EFSA’s reliance on panel-specific mandates rather than its broader remit, anonymized declarations, and exemptions for experts from industry-linked organizations. It demanded a two-year cooling-off period for experts transitioning to the agri-food sector and compliance with the European Ombudsman’s ruling to revise transparency rules, particularly for academic financial disclosures. Internal control weaknesses were flagged, including unmet standards on staff appraisal and document management, delayed implementation of critical audit recommendations (notably on information security), and insufficient procurement details in annual plans. The Parliament commended EFSA’s environmental initiatives and scientific focus (74% of resources allocated to scientific activities) but criticized non-transparent Management Board elections and unclear communication about EU budget funding. It urged cost reductions for transport services (€918,668 in 2013) and highlighted staffing gaps (328 of 351 posts filled). Despite these issues, the resolution approved the 2013 accounts closure, citing the Court of Auditors’ assurance of their reliability and legality, and recommended granting discharge to EFSA’s Executive Director.",

It highlighted a €500,000 carry-over for the Agency’s new Athens office, part of €1.2 million in total carry-overs, with €800,000 under Title II (59% of Title II appropriations) linked to office relocation costs. While acknowledging the Court of Auditors’ assurance on the reliability of accounts and legality of transactions, Parliament urged ENISA to address fragmented staff locations (administrative staff in Heraklion, operational staff in Athens) to reduce administrative costs. It noted delays in rent payments by Greek authorities for the Athens office, posing financial and continuity risks, though penalties were avoided. Parliament called for updates on resolving these delays and on measures to ensure workspace cost-effectiveness and environmental compliance, which ENISA had not addressed. Internal controls were deemed improved, with an Internal Control Coordinator addressing audit recommendations, though one \"Very Important\" recommendation on ex-post controls remained pending validation. Transparency efforts, including publishing declarations of interest and CVs of senior staff, were acknowledged. The resolution approved the closure of ENISA’s 2013 accounts and emphasized compliance with financial regulations and audit follow-ups.",

Budget execution reached 99.68%, with payment appropriations at 88.97%, while carryovers decreased to 10.71% (from 16.21% in 2015), reflecting stricter monitoring. Recruitment challenges persisted, with 95.7% of posts filled amid high turnover and housing costs in Frankfurt affecting staffing; gender balance was achieved (53% female staff). The Authority implemented e-procurement, open-office reforms, and wellness initiatives, though sick leave averaged seven days per employee. Transparency efforts included publishing meeting minutes, whistleblowing policies, and declarations of interest (with some delays), while six document access requests were mostly granted. Internal audits found no critical issues, and environmental measures reduced CO2 emissions. The resolution highlighted EIOPA’s role in financial stability, supervisory convergence, and consumer protection, stressing adherence to its mandate amid Brexit-related uncertainties, including potential revenue declines and operational impacts. It called for enhanced transparency through quicker publication of meeting records and safeguards for whistleblowers, while urging resource optimization to balance regulatory and supervisory tasks without overstepping its remit.",

By 2017, the BBI JU managed 82 projects involving 932 participants across 30 countries, with grants totaling €414 million, though industry contributions lagged significantly—only €26 million in-kind for operational activities and €5.8 million cash for administrative costs were validated, against expected minimums. The Commission reduced its contribution by €140 million due to industry’s low cash payments (€800,000 of €182.5 million pledged), though regulatory amendments allowed project-level private funding to boost future contributions. Financial execution showed 97% commitment and 95% payment appropriation utilization, with €172.2 million (14.51% of allocated funds) disbursed. Performance metrics exceeded 2020 targets for 7 of 8 indicators, but the leverage effect (2.077) remained below the 2.8 target. Internal controls required improvement, particularly in processes, business continuity, and document management, though audit error rates were low (1.44%). The Parliament acknowledged efficient management (sub-5% cost ratio), open participation in calls, and communication efforts, while urging progress on industry contributions, leverage goals, and audit follow-ups.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised key observations and decisions regarding the European Economic and Social Committee’s (EESC) 2017 budget implementation, noting its total budget of €133.8 million (96.5% execution rate) with significant administrative expenditures, including €19.8 million for members’ travel and subsistence. It welcomed the Court of Auditors’ finding of no material errors and no significant weaknesses in human resources or procurement. The EESC reduced staff posts by 59 (from 727 in 2013 to 665 in 2017) through inter-institutional cooperation, achieving savings of €12.5 million in infrastructure, €5 million in IT, and €500,000 in security costs. Parliament highlighted the EESC’s adoption of 155 opinions/reports, improved performance-based budgeting, and efforts to enhance transparency by publishing annual reports and declarations of interests. Concerns included underfunded IT projects (less than 3% of budget allocated), low participation in procurement tenders, and rising staff absence rates (5.5% in 2017). Environmental achievements included reduced energy consumption (11% electricity, 15% gas) and waste (13%), alongside sustainable canteen certification. Gender balance efforts saw 41.4% female managers, though flexible work arrangements remained predominantly used by women. The resolution urged swift appointment of a Human Resources Director to address role incompatibility, adoption of harassment procedures, and continued inter-institutional collaboration to optimize budgets. It also called for mid-term IT strategies, conflict-of-interest guidelines, and updates on ethical frameworks and building policy negotiations, particularly regarding the VMA building’s future use.",

While the Court of Auditors affirmed the reliability of accounts and legality of transactions, issues included delays in Strasbourg premises construction (70% completion, pending litigation), high carry-over cancellations (€658,000, 12.2% of total), and staffing shortages (87.02% establishment plan fulfillment, 114/131 posts filled). The Agency faced criticism for over-reliance on external contractors (90% of IT work outsourced), procurement weaknesses (limited competition, audit findings on contract valuation), and gender imbalance in its Management Board (46 male vs. 6 female members). Parliament urged mitigation of operational risks from staff gaps, improved transparency (publishing CVs and declarations of interest), and a cost-benefit analysis for integrating non-interoperable IT systems. It acknowledged the Agency’s 2018-2022 strategy, performance indicators, and cooperation with EU agencies but stressed the need for reduced contractor dependency, enhanced confidentiality measures, and resolution of audit recommendations (23 open, including 3 overdue). The closure of 2017 accounts was approved, contingent on addressing these challenges.",

However, it criticized the lack of clear separation between FP7 and Horizon 2020 budget executions, revealing FP7 commitments reached 98.13% (€252.11 million of €256.89 million) and payments 65.84% (€44.98 million of €68.31 million), while Horizon 2020 saw 100% commitments (€96.15 million) but 0% payments. The resolution highlighted insufficient information on in-kind contributions and ex-post audits, though FCH2 launched 22 new audits in 2014, achieving a residual error rate below 2%. It acknowledged FCH2’s establishment in 2014 with a maximum EU contribution of €665 million (plus €470 million for FCH) and urged improved budget planning, harmonized reporting, and enhanced performance audits. The Parliament welcomed FCH2’s socio-economic impact assessments and visibility efforts but called for clearer monitoring of multiannual projects and financial transparency, particularly in separating FP7 and Horizon 2020 data.",

It highlighted the Council’s refusal to separate its budget from the European Council’s despite repeated recommendations, insufficient disclosure of building policy costs—including delayed Europa building expenses—and the absence of publicly accessible whistleblowing rules despite 2015 ethics guidelines. The resolution criticized the Council’s ongoing non-cooperation in providing substantive answers to parliamentary inquiries, failure to join the EU transparency register, and lack of detailed anti-corruption policies. It noted improvements in corporate transparency and the first-time provision of annual activity reports from specific directorates but emphasized that unresolved issues from prior years (2009-2014) and the 2015 postponement undermined democratic accountability. Parliament reiterated its Treaty-mandated role in budget scrutiny, insisting all institutions must ensure transparency and legality in budget execution, and stressed the need for the Council to align with other EU bodies in adhering to discharge procedures to safeguard taxpayers’ interests.",

High carry-overs for operational expenditure (86%, €4.9 million) were noted, linked to long-term regulatory tasks under Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011, though the Agency attributed this to contractual cycles and achieved 100% commitment for REMIT-related funds. Staffing included 112 employees (38% female, 62% male), with 15 new temporary agents added. Work-life balance initiatives and anti-harassment policies were acknowledged, alongside transparency measures like publishing conflicts of interest and introducing a register for the Director’s external meetings. Internal controls met standards, but improvements in IT governance and procurement planning were urged following an audit identifying inefficiencies.

The Court of Auditors confirmed reliable accounts but noted issues, including unauthorized acceptance of €2.8 million in supplies without prior budgetary or contractual commitments, later regularized retroactively. Budget execution rates were 97.9% (commitments) and 97.6% (payments), with high administrative carry-overs (€5 million, 63% of Title II commitments) linked to building maintenance and consultancy. A €21.5 million construction contract for Strasbourg premises saw full payment by 2016 despite only half completion, raising concerns over advance payments. Procurement flaws included a €194 million framework contract for VIS/BMS development, which risked limited competition due to proprietary technology requirements. Staffing challenges included understaffing (114 of 118 posts filled), over-reliance on external personnel, and severe gender imbalances (28% female staff; 11% female management board members). Internal audits identified weaknesses in IT project management and HR processes, though the Agency maintained stable operations of critical systems (SIS II, Eurodac) and supported new EU initiatives. Anti-fraud strategy implementation improved from 60% to 80%, but whistleblowing rules remained pending.

It highlighted issues such as prolonged ad interim leadership exceeding statutory limits by eight months, leading to 15 temporary staff arrangements, and a gender imbalance (62% female staff). Financial management saw 41% carry-over of operational funds, primarily for multi-annual projects like disease surveillance (€1.3 million) and public health IT (€2.1 million), with the Court of Auditors urging better budget alignment. The ECDC addressed procurement transparency weaknesses, adopted anti-fraud measures, and finalized an independence policy to manage conflicts of interest. Achievements included responding to 41 Commission requests, publishing 158 reports (38 risk assessments), managing Zika and Salmonella outbreaks, expanding disease surveillance tools, and winning the 2016 European Health Award for antibiotic awareness efforts. Internal audits flagged procurement planning gaps, prompting corrective actions. Staff policies emphasized well-being (€810 per staff member) and low sick leave (1.10 days average), while resource constraints delayed some activities.

It highlighted ongoing fraud risks, including a Greek case involving the port of Piraeus, and criticized fragmented customs controls incentivizing fraud. The resolution urged the Commission to recover lost funds, enforce the Union Customs Code to prevent carousel fraud, and harmonize customs sanctions. It called for periodic estimates of the \"customs gap\" from 2019, accelerated implementation of a definitive VAT system to combat evasion, and EU-level oversight of customs to ensure harmonized treatment. The Parliament stressed the need for all Member States to join the European Public Prosecutor’s Office and endorsed measures under the Customs 2020 Regulation to strengthen fraud prevention. It also pressed for swift adoption of a legal framework for harmonized customs sanctions and emphasized protecting traditional own resources, which contribute 12.8% of EU revenue.",
