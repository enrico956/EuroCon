It stressed that EU criminal legislation must respect fundamental rights, including the presumption of innocence, legal certainty (*lex certa*), non-retroactivity, and the principle of individual guilt (*nulla poena sine culpa*), while allowing corporate liability in exceptional cases. The resolution highlighted the necessity of factual evidence to justify criminal provisions, requiring proof that less intrusive measures are insufficient, offenses are serious and widespread, and sanctions are proportionate under Article 49(3) of the EU Charter. It called for harmonization to support mutual recognition of judicial decisions, urging coherent enforcement of existing laws, uniform minimum standards for suspects’ rights, and non-legislative measures to build trust among Member States. The Parliament criticized fragmented approaches, advocating for inter-institutional coordination via agreements and working groups to ensure quality, consistency, and reduced conflicts in EU criminal law. It demanded rigorous Commission impact assessments, alignment with principles like necessity and proportionality, and enhanced parliamentary oversight through legal analyses of proposals. References to Treaty provisions (e.g., Article 83 TFEU) underscored the legal basis for EU action while respecting national criminal justice systems.",

It highlighted disparities in asylum application distribution, noting that in 2011, ten Member States handled over 90% of applications, while only 4,125 refugees were resettled across ten states, and 227 beneficiaries were relocated from Malta. The resolution called for financial and administrative support to Member States facing disproportionate pressures, particularly those at EU entry points, through tools like the Asylum and Migration Fund (AMF) and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), which should prioritize emergency assistance, capacity-building, and coordination of joint processing and relocation schemes. It criticized the Dublin Regulation for placing undue burdens on border states and urged reforms, including a potential EU distribution key for relocation based on GDP, population, and integration capacity. The Parliament stressed the importance of data collection, compliance with non-refoulement, and safeguarding asylum seekers' rights, while addressing xenophobia through awareness campaigns. It advocated for flexible funding under the AMF, including up to 90% EU co-financing for critical projects, and urged cooperation with third countries to address root causes of migration. The resolution also called for evaluating the Temporary Protection Directive’s activation criteria and improving mutual trust via consistent asylum standards and early warning mechanisms to prevent systemic failures.",

It stressed that the Treaty’s new legal framework, including Article 15 TFEU and Article 42 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, mandates all EU institutions, bodies, and agencies—not just Parliament, Council, and Commission—to operate openly, ensuring citizens’ right to access documents and participate in democratic processes. The resolution highlighted the abolition of intergovernmental regimes in judicial and police cooperation, integrating these areas into EU law to strengthen parliamentary oversight and public scrutiny. It called for binding interinstitutional agreements by 30 June 2010 to improve document accessibility, including legislative and non-legislative processes, and urged reforms to internal rules, registers, and digital platforms like EUR-LEX to consolidate transparency. The Parliament rejected any attempts to reduce access rights, citing ECJ rulings that link openness to institutional legitimacy, and emphasized the need for transparency in EU fund management and policy implementation, aligning with the European Transparency Initiative. It also demanded clarity in distinguishing public access to documents from internal communications and stressed the importance of timely, comprehensive information for citizens and national parliaments to monitor decision-making. The resolution welcomed the Commission’s December 2009 communication updating the regulation’s legal basis but criticized delays in substantive reforms, urging immediate political dialogue to finalize the updated framework.",

This visa would allow third-country nationals at risk of persecution or harm to enter a Member State solely to apply for asylum, complementing—not replacing—existing national humanitarian entry schemes and resettlement programs. The proposed visa would require streamlined procedures: applications via embassies/consulates, security screenings, a 15-day processing window, appeal rights, and gender-sensitive assessments recognizing persecution based on gender-based violence (e.g., rape, forced marriage). Financial solidarity under Article 80 TFEU was emphasized, with EU funds covering costs, mirroring resettlement compensation.

It emphasized that AI systems must comply with EU data protection laws (GDPR, Law Enforcement Directive) and respect human dignity, transparency, accountability, and proportionality, prohibiting uses incompatible with fundamental rights, such as mass surveillance or predictive policing based on historical data that perpetuates biases against marginalized groups. The resolution called for strict safeguards, including mandatory fundamental rights impact assessments, independent audits, and transparency in AI development and deployment, particularly for high-risk applications like facial recognition, biometric identification, and emotion detection, which should be limited to necessary, lawful purposes with human oversight. It advocated a moratorium on law enforcement use of facial recognition for identification unless for victim identification, and a ban on private databases like Clearview AI (holding 3 billion illegally scraped images) and AI-driven mass scoring. The Parliament stressed the need for human accountability in decisions affecting legal rights, prohibitions on fully automated judicial rulings, and safeguards against biased datasets that disproportionately harm racialized communities, women, and children. It urged investment in interdisciplinary research, anti-discrimination training, and international cooperation to align AI standards with EU values, while halting EU funding for projects like iBorderCtrl that enable biometric mass surveillance. The resolution also demanded transparency on AI tools used by Member States, public procurement standards, and guidelines from EU agencies to ensure compliance with ethical and legal frameworks.",

The resolution emphasized CJEU clarifications on these issues, including the definition of \"judicial authority\" (limited to independent judges/prosecutors) and the applicability of fundamental rights safeguards under the ECHR and EU Charter. It called for expanding the list of 32 offenses (e.g., to include hate crimes) or adopting a \"negative list\" system for Member States to predefine non-extraditable offenses, as initially proposed in 2001. Coherence gaps with other mutual recognition instruments (e.g., the European Investigation Order) and procedural rights directives were noted, alongside recommendations for soft-law measures (training, manuals), targeted legislation (harmonizing pre-trial detention standards), and establishing an EU criminal code. The resolution stressed the need for enhanced judicial training, full transposition of procedural rights directives, and infringement proceedings against non-compliant Member States to strengthen mutual trust. It also urged addressing statistical inconsistencies in EAW enforcement data and improving harmonization of prison conditions and evidentiary standards to ensure high-level protections.",

These lawsuits, frequently initiated by powerful entities or public officials, aim to drain targets’ financial and psychological resources, undermine media freedom, public participation, and the rule of law, and create a chilling effect on democratic discourse. The resolution highlighted that 23 EU Member States still criminalize defamation, contrary to international recommendations, and cited cases like Daphne Caruana Galizia, who faced 47 lawsuits before her assassination. It called for EU legislation, including amendments to the Brussels I and Rome II Regulations to prevent forum shopping, a directive establishing minimum safeguards (e.g., early dismissal mechanisms, penalties for abusive claimants, and compensation for victims), and decriminalization of defamation. The Parliament urged financial and psychological support for SLAPP victims, alignment with the Whistleblower Directive, and integration of anti-SLAPP measures into EU policies like the Rule of Law Mechanism and the Justice Programme. It emphasized the need to protect internal market freedoms, ensure judicial independence, and address SLAPPs’ cross-border nature, while safeguarding legitimate legal claims and preventing misuse of anti-SLAPP measures. The resolution also stressed complementarity with anti-corruption efforts, media pluralism, and the EU’s democracy action plan, urging Member States to enhance transparency, implement the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, and promote media literacy.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised its approval of the amended Commission proposal (COM(2021)0278) aimed at strengthening regulatory measures, incorporating amendments to 29 recitals and 45 articles across the proposed regulation. Key amendments included modifications to definitions, procedural requirements, and institutional mandates, with specific adjustments to Articles 1–3, 4–12, 14–23, 26, and 30, as well as the addition of new provisions such as Article 21(6a–6b) and Article 30a. The resolution emphasized enhanced compliance mechanisms, clearer criteria for member state obligations, and reinforced oversight frameworks. It called on the Commission to revise its proposal in line with Parliament’s amendments under Article 293(2) TFEU and urged the Council to consult Parliament again if intending substantial deviations, while instructing the transmission of Parliament’s position to EU institutions and national parliaments. Contributions from the Czech, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian parliaments were acknowledged in shaping the legislative process.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised support for the European Commission’s draft adequacy decisions recognizing the UK’s data protection framework as essentially equivalent to EU standards under the GDPR and Law Enforcement Directive (LED), while emphasizing the need for rigorous monitoring. It noted the UK’s incorporation of GDPR into national law, retention of EU-derived legislation post-Brexit, and adherence to the ECHR and Convention 108+, but highlighted concerns over potential divergences, including the UK’s 2020 National Data Strategy signaling a shift toward broader data use. The resolution underscored risks posed by UK exemptions, such as the immigration control derogation restricting data subject rights, which was invoked in over 70% of Home Office data requests in 2020 (17,780 requests affecting 146.75 million individuals). It acknowledged UK surveillance reforms under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, including judicial oversight and redress mechanisms, but stressed vigilance over onward data transfers to third countries, particularly the UK-US data-sharing agreement under the CLOUD Act. The Parliament welcomed the inclusion of a four-year sunset clause in the adequacy decisions, requiring reassessment by 2025, and urged the Commission to suspend or repeal decisions if UK standards weaken, prioritizing legal certainty for businesses and safeguarding EU citizens’ rights. It also emphasized the UK’s exclusion from EU databases like the Schengen Information System and called for ongoing scrutiny of UK law enforcement practices to ensure compliance with EU data protection principles.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised grave concerns over escalating violence, human rights abuses, and systemic attacks against journalists and human rights defenders in Mexico, noting that 2022 marked the deadliest start to a year for journalists, with at least six killed, including high-profile cases like María de Lourdes Maldonado López and Heber López Vásquez. Since 2018, at least 47 journalists and 68 human rights defenders have been murdered, with impunity rates around 95% for such crimes, perpetuated by corruption, inadequate judicial reforms, and collusion between authorities and criminal groups. The resolution condemned President López Obrador’s stigmatizing rhetoric against independent media and his administration’s use of state platforms to attack critics, exacerbating risks for journalists. It highlighted severe deficiencies in Mexico’s Federal Protection Mechanism, which safeguards 1,518 individuals (1,023 defenders and 495 journalists) but suffers from underfunding, delays, and poor coordination, leading to at least nine deaths among those under protection. The Parliament urged Mexico to strengthen institutions, implement international standards, and adopt gender-sensitive strategies to protect activists and journalists, while addressing legislative threats like a proposed NGO funding ban and concerning electoral reforms. It emphasized the EU-Mexico Global Agreement’s human rights clauses and called for prioritizing the Escazú Agreement’s implementation to protect environmental defenders. The resolution further demanded robust cooperation with UN bodies, expanded EU-Mexico dialogues on human rights, and immediate action to end impunity, ensure justice for victims, and uphold press freedom and democratic values.",
