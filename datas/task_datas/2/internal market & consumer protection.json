    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about persistent late payments in commercial transactions, particularly harming SMEs, which face liquidity issues, increased bankruptcy risks (1 in 4 EU bankruptcies linked to late payments), and unfair power imbalances with larger firms. It emphasized Directive 2011/7/EU’s role in setting payment terms (30 days for public authorities, 60 days for businesses), statutory interest (≥8% above ECB rates), and minimum €40 compensation for recovery costs, but noted inadequate enforcement, with 60% of businesses still paid late in B2B transactions and 95% of SMEs experiencing delayed payments. The resolution urged stricter national enforcement, including shorter payment terms (ideally 30 days), mandatory transparency on payment behavior, and administrative sanctions for non-compliance. It highlighted the economic cost of late payments, estimating €158 million daily savings and 6.5 million additional jobs if delays were reduced. Recommendations included promoting mediation services, SME training in credit management, leveraging digital payment technologies, and aligning public procurement rules with prompt payment principles. The Parliament also called for EU-wide guidelines to clarify ambiguous terms in the Directive, stronger synergies between late payment rules and sector-specific initiatives (e.g., food supply chains), and Commission action against non-compliant Member States, including ongoing infringement procedures against Greece, Slovakia, Spain, and Italy.",

The resolution called for stricter enforcement, cross-border cooperation among national authorities, penalties for non-compliance, and transparency measures such as a public database of test results.

It urged the Commission to establish minimum resistance criteria for products, focusing on robustness, repairability, and upgradeability, and to combat planned obsolescence through an EU-wide definition, independent testing systems, and penalties for manufacturers. The resolution emphasized improving consumer information via a voluntary EU label indicating product durability, repairability, and lifespan, supported by standardized manuals and digital tools, while noting that 77% of EU consumers prefer repairing goods over replacements. It advocated for accessible spare parts, affordable repair services, and support for SMEs in the repair sector, highlighting job losses in the Netherlands (2,000 jobs lost in 7 years) and Germany (13% repair shop closures annually). The Parliament encouraged modular design, extended producer responsibility, and public procurement favoring durable goods, alongside fiscal incentives like Sweden’s VAT reduction (25% to 12%) on repairs and tax deductions for repair costs. Measures against software obsolescence included mandatory security updates, reversible upgrades, and compatibility requirements. The resolution also stressed harmonizing national initiatives, such as France’s criminalization of planned obsolescence and Austria’s repair-friendly appliance label, to strengthen the internal market, reduce electronic waste, and align with the Ecodesign Working Plan 2016-2019 and Circular Economy Package objectives.",

The resolution stressed the necessity of professional sign language interpretation as a critical accessibility measure or reasonable accommodation in education, employment, healthcare, justice, and public services, noting disparities in TV subtitling (10%-100% coverage) and the lack of standardized interpretation data. It urged Member States to promote sign language learning, ensure bilingual education with qualified interpreters, and adopt minimum accessibility standards for digital and emergency communication. The EU institutions were called to lead by example, providing equal status for sign language interpreters, improving staff accommodations, and implementing projects like INSIGN for real-time sign language services. It also criticized the exclusion of sign language interpretation from the European Disability Card Pilot Project, which hinders mobility, and emphasized the need for inclusive Erasmus+ programs, accessible political processes, and data collection via Eurostat to inform policy. The resolution underscored that accessibility and reasonable accommodation are complementary obligations, with disproportionality claims invalidating denial of access, and affirmed sign languages’ linguistic equality, urging their integration into EU multilingualism policies.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over widespread unfair trading practices (UTPs) in the EU food supply chain, particularly harming farmers, SMEs, and microenterprises, which constitute 99.1% of the sector. UTPs—including forced payments for non-beneficial services, territorial supply constraints, late payments, and exploitative pricing—stem from power imbalances exacerbated by market concentration, with large retailers and processors leveraging dominance over weaker suppliers. The sector, vital to the EU economy, employs 47 million people, contributes 7% of EU GDP (€1.05 billion market value), and faces crises in dairy, meat, and produce sectors due to unsustainable practices like selling below production costs. Despite voluntary initiatives like the Supply Chain Initiative (SCI), which lacks enforcement, anonymity, and farmer participation, UTPs persist, causing reduced investment, innovation, and food waste while limiting consumer choice. The resolution urges binding EU legislation to prohibit UTPs, enforce fair practices, and establish independent national enforcement bodies with investigatory powers, modeled after the UK Groceries Code Adjudicator, to ensure confidential complaints and penalties. It emphasizes strengthening producer organizations (POs) for collective bargaining, enhancing transparency via price monitoring tools, and revising competition rules to address retailer-owned brands’ anti-competitive risks. Cross-border cooperation and harmonization are critical to prevent forum shopping and ensure equitable market conditions, safeguarding farmers’ viability and consumer interests.",

Key substantive changes include expanding definitions of regulated entities (Articles 1-2), enhancing obligations for compliance monitoring (Articles 4-8), and introducing stricter data-sharing requirements between member states and EU bodies (Articles 10-12). The resolution mandates risk assessments for emerging technologies (Article 15), reinforces safeguards for vulnerable groups (Articles 19-20), and establishes a centralized EU database for enforcement tracking (Article 22). It introduces penalties for non-compliance, including fines up to 4% of annual turnover (Article 31), and requires biennial reporting on implementation (Article 35). Amendments also prioritize environmental sustainability (Recitals 36a, 40b) and gender equality (Recital 97a), while streamlining cross-border cooperation mechanisms (Articles 48-52). The Parliament instructed the Commission to revise its proposal if substantial changes occur and emphasized alignment with the European Economic and Social Committee and Committee of the Regions’ 2021 opinions.",

Key proposals included revising the Ecodesign Directive to mandate durable, repairable product design, ensuring access to spare parts and repair manuals for consumers and independent repairers, and requiring software updates for digital goods to prevent premature obsolescence. The resolution called for harmonized consumer information on product repairability, durability, and software update availability, including standardized labels, digital passports, and QR codes. It urged extending legal guarantees beyond the current two-year minimum under the Sale of Goods Directive, incentivizing repair over replacement through financial measures, and promoting green public procurement favoring repaired or refurbished products. The Commission was tasked with assessing joint manufacturer-seller liability, banning destructive disposal of unsold goods, and conducting impact analyses to balance sustainability, consumer protection, and business competitiveness, particularly for SMEs.
