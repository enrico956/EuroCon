It called for concrete strategies and EU policies tailored to these regions, maintaining GDP as the primary criterion for funding but urging the Commission and Member States to develop supplementary territorialized indicators (e.g., population density, unemployment rates) to better assess disparities. The resolution advocated a dedicated EU policy framework, integrating Structural Funds (2007-2013), the Cohesion Fund, and other financial instruments, to enhance competitiveness and address structural challenges, while stressing the role of regional authorities in sustainable development aligned with the EU2020 strategy’s energy and R&D goals. It recommended revising cross-border cooperation criteria by eliminating the 150 km distance requirement for islands, proposing maritime basin-level assessments instead, and encouraged the use of European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation (EGTCs) to foster cross-border projects. The Parliament also urged continued financial support for these regions in future EU budgets and emphasized leveraging European Neighbourhood Policy tools to strengthen regional integration.",

The resolution highlighted the need for standardized, secure, and interoperable eHealth frameworks, including an EU-wide interoperability framework by 2015, to enable seamless data exchange and avoid monopolies, alongside robust data protection measures to safeguard sensitive health information. It stressed closing the digital gap through EU structural funds and Horizon 2020 investments in broadband infrastructure, particularly in underserved regions, and promoting digital literacy, especially among elderly women and marginalized groups. Gender-sensitive approaches were urged to address women’s disproportionate burden of chronic diseases and their underrepresentation in ICT roles, while advocating for eHealth tools supporting informal caregivers, often women. The Parliament called for SME support to foster innovation, ensure market competition, and avoid affordability barriers, alongside regulatory clarity on liability, reimbursement, and cross-border health data sharing. It emphasized preserving the human dimension of healthcare, avoiding eHealth as a substitute for patient-provider trust, and integrating patient and professional input in system design. Chronic disease management via home-based eHealth solutions and mobile apps with verified medical content was prioritized, alongside biennial progress reviews of the Action Plan to measure impact and address inequalities. Collaboration with international bodies like the WHO and OECD, as well as EU-US partnerships on interoperability standards, was underscored to align global health initiatives.",

It stressed the urgency of adopting an ambitious post-2010 CBD Strategic Plan with measurable 2020 targets to halt biodiversity loss, ensure equitable sharing of genetic resource benefits, and protect ecosystems by 2050. The resolution called for a legally binding ABS Protocol at COP 10 to address biopiracy, enforce fair benefit-sharing, and uphold indigenous rights, including free prior informed consent for traditional knowledge access. It urged the EU to lead global efforts by securing marine biodiversity protections, expanding terrestrial and marine protected areas, integrating biodiversity safeguards into climate policies (e.g., REDD+ reforms), and combating invasive species. The Parliament emphasized financing through market mechanisms (e.g., habitat banking, payment for ecosystem services), increased public and private funding, and corporate accountability. It advocated synergies among Rio Conventions, supported the IPBES platform for science-policy integration, and demanded biodiversity integration into trade agreements and MDGs. Specific measures included banning patents on life forms, establishing biofuel sustainability criteria, and reforming forest definitions to distinguish native ecosystems from monocultures. The resolution highlighted the need for transparent indicators, improved data tools like BISE, and equitable recognition of indigenous land rights in conservation strategies.",

The resolution called for rapid ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreement, noting that 55 Parties representing 55% of global emissions were needed for entry into force, with 27 states (39.08% of emissions) having ratified by September 2016. It underscored sectoral priorities, including phasing out coal, integrating land use (LULUCF) into EU climate frameworks, addressing aviation and shipping emissions via ICAO and IMO, and reducing deforestation (20% of global emissions). The EU was urged to lead in climate finance, mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020 for developing countries, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, and promoting carbon pricing. Adaptation measures, support for climate-vulnerable regions (notably Africa and small island states), and addressing climate-induced migration were emphasized. The resolution advocated for a circular economy, renewable energy deployment, and innovation in low-carbon technologies, while stressing systemic financial risks from delayed decarbonization. It highlighted the role of non-state actors, transparency in climate diplomacy, and the need for EU leadership in global forums to ensure compliance with Paris goals.",

The resolution calls for binding cross-sectoral measures to cut methane emissions by at least 45% by 2030, aligning with the Paris Agreement and the European Climate Law’s goal of 55% emissions reduction by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. Key sectoral targets include a 75% reduction in energy-related methane emissions by 2030, leveraging cost-effective solutions like leak detection and repair (LDAR) in fossil fuel infrastructure, banning routine venting and flaring, and imposing methane standards on energy imports, which account for over 80% of EU fossil fuel consumption. In agriculture (53% of EU methane emissions), the resolution advocates sustainable livestock practices, feed additives, and manure management, while addressing waste (26% of emissions) through stricter landfill management, bio-waste recycling, and revised directives to curb emissions from sewage and wastewater. It highlights the economic feasibility of mitigation, noting 60% of measures in energy, waste, and agriculture are low-cost, with 50% having negative costs. The resolution stresses international leadership, urging a binding global methane agreement, support for an independent methane emissions observatory, and satellite-based monitoring to tackle super-emitters. It also underscores health benefits, including preventing 1,430 annual premature deaths per million tonnes of methane reduced, and aligning methane action with air quality, biodiversity, and circular economy goals.",

This trade, generating high profits with minimal risk, compromises animal welfare through inhumane breeding and transport conditions, including early separation from mothers, poor socialization, and exposure to disease, malnutrition, and stress during transit. Public health risks are significant, with zoonotic threats such as rabies and *Echinococcus multilocularis* linked to unvaccinated or untreated animals. The resolution highlighted that 65% of Eurobarometer respondents viewed the internet as unsafe for purchasing pets, while 42% of inspected online advertisements showed inconsistencies between traders’ status and activities. It stressed the need for a harmonized EU-wide mandatory identification and registration system for cats and dogs, including microchipping by veterinarians and interconnected national databases to ensure traceability. The Commission was urged to propose an EU action plan by 2024, leveraging the Animal Health Law (applicable from April 2021) to regulate online sales, enforce stricter penalties for illegal traders, and establish common breeding standards. Recommendations included mandatory validation checks for online pet advertisements, consumer protection measures, and enhanced cooperation between Member States on inspections, data sharing, and awareness campaigns. The resolution also emphasized addressing tax revenue losses, unfair market competition, and the need for cross-agency collaboration to combat smuggling and improve border controls, while ensuring adequate support for animal rescue centers and compliance with EU privacy rules in data handling.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over disparities in COVID-19 testing accessibility and affordability across Member States, emphasizing that free movement rights under EU law must not be hindered by financial or socio-economic barriers. It stressed the critical role of universal, timely, and free testing—particularly for frontline workers, vulnerable populations, and cross-border commuters (noting 17 million EU citizens live or work abroad)—to prevent discrimination under the EU COVID-19 certificate framework. The resolution called for Member States to ensure free testing, introduce temporary price caps for non-certificate tests, and expand testing capacities, including in border regions and transport hubs. It urged joint procurement of tests (citing the Commission’s purchase of 20 million rapid antigen tests) and increased transparency in health procurement. The Parliament highlighted the need for equitable access to NAAT tests, funding for innovative testing methods via the HERA incubator, and use of the Emergency Support Instrument to cover testing costs. It demanded clear, centralized information on testing availability and costs via the Re-open EU platform and a dedicated app, while underlining the importance of reporting all test results to monitor variants. The resolution linked affordable testing to economic recovery, social equity, and the unimpeded exercise of fundamental freedoms, urging alignment with EU-wide strategies to mitigate pandemic-related inequalities.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the critical role of green infrastructure in addressing urban challenges, climate change, and biodiversity loss, noting that 72% of EU citizens live in urban areas, projected to reach 80% by 2020. It emphasized green infrastructure’s benefits, including mitigating climate impacts (e.g., carbon sequestration, flood risk reduction), enhancing biodiversity (22% of European species face extinction), improving public health (430,000 annual premature deaths linked to air pollution), and boosting economic value through ecosystem services worth €300 billion annually via Natura 2000. The resolution called for a new EU strategy for greener cities under the European Green Deal, integrating climate adaptation measures, promoting nature-based solutions, and designating 2022 as the European Year of Greener Cities to raise awareness, expand green spaces, foster research, and encourage citizen participation. It urged measures to improve air quality, reduce urban traffic, support sustainable mobility, and enhance waste and water management. The Parliament stressed the need for funding via public-private partnerships, EU programs, and SME incentives, while advocating for urban policies that prioritize green corridors, permeable surfaces, green roofs, and urban gardening. It highlighted the importance of mainstreaming biodiversity into urban planning, improving connectivity of green-blue corridors, and ensuring equitable access to nature for vulnerable groups. The resolution also linked greener cities to achieving the Paris Agreement, UN Sustainable Development Goals, and a zero-waste target, urging Member States and local authorities to adopt action plans and engage stakeholders in creating resilient, inclusive, and low-emission urban environments.",
