It highlighted that €16.2 billion in unpaid cohesion policy claims from 2007-2013 had rolled over into 2013, reducing available funds, and stressed the need to honor a December 2012 interinstitutional commitment to settle unpaid 2012 claims. The resolution acknowledged the Council’s adoption of €7.3 billion as a first tranche under a June 2013 political agreement on the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), but warned this might be insufficient, particularly given late-year invoice submissions under heading 1b due to N+2/N+3 rules. It insisted on a second amending budget in early autumn to cover the remaining €11.2 billion deficit, linking its approval to the adoption of the 2014-2020 MFF Regulation and 2014 budget. The Parliament emphasized that the Commission’s data on payment needs, aggregated from member states, should not be contested by the Council, and noted that adopting a subsequent amending budget (No 3/2013) would reduce member states’ GNI contributions, partially offsetting their costs. It approved the Council’s position on Draft Amending Budget No 2/2013 but urged binding solutions if the proposed funds proved inadequate, stressing mutual trust and the imperative to prevent payment shifts into the next MFF.",

It demanded a March 2013 draft amending budget to cover €2.9 billion in suspended 2012 claims and called for monthly reports on Member States’ payment claims to improve transparency. The Parliament stressed the EU budget’s role in driving growth, jobs, and competitiveness, noting its leverage effect as 94% of the budget—1% of EU GDP—returns to Member States through investments in education, SMEs, infrastructure, and youth employment. It opposed cuts to the EU budget, arguing this would undermine cohesion and solidarity, and urged reforms to diversify EU revenue through a financial transaction tax and EU VAT, reducing reliance on national contributions. The resolution also cautioned against staffing reductions in EU institutions without impact assessments and emphasized aligning the 2014 budget with the EU 2020 strategy and Growth and Jobs Compact to ensure synergies between national and EU-level fiscal priorities.",

Private Members’ in-kind contributions reached €58.7 million, alongside €3.6 million in administrative cash contributions. The resolution noted internal audit risks in fraud management and ex-post controls but commended mitigation efforts, urged improved Participating State contributions, and called for the Commission to involve ECSEL in Horizon 2020’s mid-term review for procedural harmonization.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised key observations and decisions regarding the European Ombudsman’s 2015 budget implementation, noting the Court of Auditors found no significant weaknesses in human resources or procurement and confirmed administrative expenditures were free from material error. The Ombudsman’s budget totaled €10,346,105 (up from €9,857,024 in 2014), with 92.32% of appropriations committed and 86.19% paid, reflecting a declining utilization rate that prompted reductions in budget lines for missions, representation, and translations. Parliament urged wider application of performance-based budgeting (PBB) with SMART targets across departments and staff, while acknowledging the Ombudsman’s transparency leadership but calling for improved recruitment transparency, updated organizational charts, and clarified roles for senior advisers. It welcomed the Ombudsman’s investigations into \"revolving door\" cases and whistleblower protection rules but highlighted concerns over geographic imbalance in management (particularly overrepresentation from the Ombudsman’s home country) and requested analysis of compliance rates (90% in 2015) and reasons for non-compliance by EU institutions. Gender balance at management level was praised, while staff reduction plans (5% over five years) and new post creations in 2016 required clarification. Environmental efforts like EMAS compliance and green mobility were endorsed, alongside calls for carbon offsetting rules. Parliament also sought details on two 2015 data protection complaints, stressed the need for annual impact reports, and urged national ombudsmen and EU bodies to promote citizen awareness of the Ombudsman’s role in addressing maladministration.",

Despite a 99.34% budget implementation rate and 89.70% payment execution, a 6% budget cut forced delays in work programs and reduced participation in key forums like the Basel Committee. A €1.9 million budget amendment was necessitated by GBP/EUR exchange rate volatility. Staff increased to 156 (45% female), with improved carryover rates (9.7% in 2015, down from 15.9% in 2014), though transparency gaps remained, including unpublished CVs of management bodies. Post-Brexit risks were highlighted, including the EBA’s London lease (break clause penalty of €3.2 million) and potential relocation costs, urging transparent decision-making. The Parliament criticized the EBA’s reliance on national contributions, advocating a shift to EU funding and market participant fees. It called for timely publication of meeting minutes (currently delayed by three months), enhanced whistleblower protections, and stricter adherence to mandates, emphasizing proportionality and stakeholder involvement in regulatory processes. Performance audits noted manageable HR and IT recommendations, while cooperation with other EU agencies was encouraged to reduce costs.",

It acknowledged the Court of Auditors’ assurance on the reliability of accounts and legality of transactions, while highlighting concerns over high carry-overs for operational expenditure (€2.14 million, 31.2% of Title III commitments), attributed to multi-annual projects. The resolution commended efforts to improve transparency, including publishing declarations of interest, but urged completion of missing governing board documents. It noted staffing challenges, including a 10% staff reduction impacting project delays, and called for resource solutions to sustain pan-European surveys and address emerging priorities like migrant labor. Procurement procedures were deemed compliant, with five contracts reviewed by the advisory committee, and internal controls were strengthened through staff training and anti-fraud measures. The Foundation’s performance fell short of its 80% output target due to contractor delays and staff shortages, though 2016 planning was adjusted for realism. The resolution welcomed the 2015 headquarters agreement with Ireland and stressed the need for adequate infrastructure and transport links.

The Foundation achieved a 99.89% budget implementation rate and 96.04% payment execution, with carry-overs decreasing to 3.3% overall (1.4% for staff expenditure, 16.1% for administrative costs) but rising to 36.4% for operational activities due to delayed funding transfers. Nine budgetary transfers were made, aligned with financial rules. Criticisms included incomplete publication of governing board members’ conflict-of-interest declarations, some accessible only via password, urging stricter transparency measures. Internal audits noted one open recommendation (downgraded to “important”) and positive ex-post audit results despite areas for improvement. The Parliament commended the Foundation’s 96% work program achievement rate, contributions to education reforms, migration dialogue (noting the MISMES inventory and NEETs analysis), compliance with EU Staff Regulations, and efforts to secure assets.

The Court of Auditors issued unqualified opinions for all agencies except Frontex (qualified) and flagged elevated carry-overs in 32 agencies, urging clearer distinctions between planned and unplanned carry-overs to align with multiannual programming. It called for streamlined financial regulations, improved grant management, and shared services to enhance efficiency, citing a cloud services initiative saving €2.5 million. Concerns included staff reductions (5% target by 2017) straining agencies like the European Food Safety Authority, underrepresentation of post-2004 Member States in senior roles, and insufficient gender balance. Transparency measures were urged, including stricter conflict-of-interest declarations, whistleblower protections (65% of agencies lacked internal rules), and public access to documents. The resolution highlighted Brexit’s impact on UK-based agencies and stressed the need for evaluations to optimize synergies and avoid duplication. It welcomed cooperation among justice and home affairs agencies but criticized inadequate performance indicators and structural inefficiencies. Finally, it called for resolving audit burdens from private-sector outsourcing and ensuring agencies’ operational continuity amid budgetary constraints.",

Key proposals include introducing a financial transaction tax (FTT), corporate income tax reforms (e.g., allocating part of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base revenue to the EU budget), and sustainability-linked measures such as a CO2 levy or emissions-based customs duties to incentivize climate-friendly trade and generate revenue. The resolution emphasizes modernizing the customs union (which contributed 12.8% of EU revenue in 2015) to combat fraud, improve duty collection, and address revenue losses from free trade agreements, while ensuring WTO compliance. It calls for abolishing rebates and correction mechanisms, advocating for at least 50% of EU budget revenue to come from new own resources, and stresses the need to offset Brexit-related revenue losses (€9–12 billion annually). Climate action is prioritized, with demands to align the budget with the Paris Agreement and allocate resources to high-value projects like energy transition. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is highlighted as vital, costing citizens 32 cents daily and supporting 500 million Europeans, though reforms are urged to enhance equity and environmental benefits. The resolution also supports creating a euro area budgetary capacity, a European Minister of Economy and Finance, and shifting to qualified majority voting for budgetary decisions to strengthen democratic accountability and EU added value.",

It emphasized boosting flagship programs while maintaining cohesion, agriculture, and fisheries funding, and integrating the UN Sustainable Development Goals, climate action, and gender equality across all policies. The resolution demanded a reformed EU revenue system, including new own resources such as a carbon border adjustment mechanism, digital services tax, and financial transaction tax, while abolishing rebates and simplifying VAT. It insisted on a rule-of-law mechanism to protect the EU budget from systemic violations of EU values. The Parliament criticized the Council’s delays in negotiations, called for immediate trilateral talks, and urged the Commission to propose an MFF contingency plan by early 2020 to extend current funding ceilings if needed, preventing program disruptions. It welcomed the incoming Commission’s commitments, including the European Green Deal, but stressed that new initiatives must not compromise the MFF’s ambition, warning against reduced funding as a setback. Climate mainstreaming was underscored as essential, requiring transparent methodologies and Parliament’s involvement in tracking climate-related spending. The resolution reaffirmed Parliament’s refusal to approve any MFF that undermines its legislative role or EU added value, stressing solidarity and efficiency through pooled resources.",

It called for transparency, regular reporting to Parliament starting by October 2021, and cooperation with OLAF and the EPPO to address issues like non-compliance with anti-fraud recommendations. The Parliament highlighted the Regulation’s unique scope to address both individual and systemic breaches across all EU funds, urging proportionality in measures while protecting legitimate beneficiaries’ rights.
