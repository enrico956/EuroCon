The resolution highlighted the need for results-based incentives, predictable disbursements, and adherence to human rights and governance standards, while cautioning that budget support should not undermine domestic resource mobilization, such as taxation, to reduce aid dependency. It called for EU-level independent evaluation systems, a public register for transparency in agreements and indicators, and policy coherence across EU trade, climate, agriculture, and security policies to align with development goals. The Parliament urged compliance with the 0.7% GDP target for development aid, criticized insufficient data in the Commission’s consultation process, and advocated for improved coordination among EU institutions and member states to avoid overlaps and strengthen impact. It also emphasized the role of sectoral budget support in advancing Millennium Development Goals, the need for risk management frameworks, and the importance of addressing fraud and corruption to safeguard aid legitimacy, while rejecting a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach in favor of tailored indicators and local context considerations.",

Parliament urged revising the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) to integrate crisis mechanisms, restore budget unity, and ensure democratic oversight, demanding regular reporting and alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly on peace, education, health, and gender equality. Concerns included coherence with EU external policies, migration cooperation under the Valletta Summit, and safeguarding humanitarian principles, while opposing cooperation with governments violating human rights. The resolution emphasized the need for holistic solutions balancing security, development, and migration challenges, ensuring funds prioritize local needs, youth empowerment, and sustainable growth.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over the persistent global HIV/AIDS crisis, noting that 38 million people live with HIV, including 1.7 million new infections in 2019, with 12 million lacking access to treatment and 700,000 AIDS-related deaths annually. It highlighted stark regional disparities, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 57% of new infections, 84% of HIV cases in children, and 4,500 weekly infections among young women. The resolution emphasized the exacerbating effects of COVID-19 on inequalities, stigma, and disrupted health services, jeopardizing the 2030 goal to end AIDS. It urged accelerated action to meet 2025 targets, including scaling up EU investments in UNAIDS and the Global Fund, ensuring universal health coverage, and integrating HIV services with sexual and reproductive health rights. The Parliament called for eliminating discriminatory laws, prioritizing key populations (e.g., LGBTQ+ individuals, sex workers, prisoners), and mandating comprehensive sexual education. It stressed the need for affordable HIV treatments through TRIPS Agreement flexibilities, opposing TRIPS-plus measures in trade deals, and pressuring pharmaceutical companies to include middle-income countries in licensing schemes. Additionally, it advocated for community-led responses, addressing gender-based vulnerabilities, and aligning COVID-19 recovery efforts with HIV lessons, such as equitable vaccine access and protecting human rights. The resolution underscored the importance of resilient health systems, EU-Africa collaboration on medical production, and data-driven strategies to tackle intersecting crises of HIV, poverty, and pandemics.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over persistent gaps in sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) globally, reaffirming commitments to the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action and the Nairobi Summit’s \"three zeros\" targets: zero unmet need for family planning, zero preventable maternal deaths, and zero gender-based violence and harmful practices. It highlighted that 214 million women in developing countries lack access to modern contraception, leading to 75 million unintended pregnancies annually, while 25 million unsafe abortions occur each year, contributing to maternal mortality. The resolution stressed the need for universal access to SRHR, including safe abortion, comprehensive sexuality education (CSE), and maternal healthcare, particularly for marginalized groups. It condemned restrictive laws, third-party authorization requirements, and ideological barriers impeding access, noting disparities within the EU and globally. The Parliament called for increased funding, including the EU’s commitment of €29 million for adolescent SRHR, and urged allocating 20% of official development assistance (ODA) to gender equality. It emphasized addressing gender-based violence, female genital mutilation (FGM), child marriage (affecting 650 million women), and discrimination against LGBTIQ individuals. The resolution linked SRHR to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), advocating for healthcare integration, youth participation, and accountability mechanisms. It criticized regressive policies in some countries and urged ratification of the Istanbul Convention, while supporting the Spotlight Initiative to combat violence against women and girls. Maternal mortality reductions (44% since 1995) and progress in contraceptive access (64% coverage by 2015) were acknowledged, but urgent action was demanded to eliminate preventable deaths, unsafe abortions, and systemic inequalities in healthcare access.",

It highlighted the COVID-19 pandemic’s exacerbation of hunger, pushing 300 million into acute food insecurity, and stressed the widening funding gap, with only 30% of the $36.6 billion UN appeal met as of August 2021. The resolution urged increased, predictable EU humanitarian funding, advocating for Member States to contribute fixed shares of their gross national incomes, and emphasized the EU’s role as the largest global donor, providing 36% of humanitarian assistance in 2020. It called for enhanced localisation of aid, aligning with the Grand Bargain 2.0 target of 25% direct funding to local actors, and supported private sector engagement through blending initiatives and disaster risk insurance, while ensuring compliance with humanitarian principles. The Parliament condemned violations of international humanitarian law, including attacks on civilians and aid workers, and demanded sanctions for using starvation as a weapon of war. It stressed the need for climate resilience, disaster risk reduction, and triple nexus approaches (humanitarian-development-peace) to address root causes of fragility, alongside gender-sensitive interventions to protect women and girls, who face heightened risks in crises. Key initiatives included the EU Humanitarian Air Bridge, climate adaptation funding via the Global Europe instrument, and the inaugural EU Humanitarian Forum in January 2022 to strengthen strategic dialogue and visibility of EU aid. The resolution also emphasized revising nutrition strategies, ensuring unhindered healthcare access, and integrating education in emergencies to protect vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities and LGBTIQ+ communities.",

It highlighted that the wealthiest 1% of the global population emitted over twice as much CO₂ as the poorest 50% between 1990 and 2015, while the richest 10% accounted for 52% of emissions, exacerbating inequalities. Climate change is projected to displace over 143 million people in Latin America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, with women—comprising 70% of the world’s poorest—disproportionately affected due to gendered roles in agriculture, water collection, and heightened risks of violence and displacement (80% of climate-displaced individuals are women and children). Indigenous peoples, safeguarding 80% of global biodiversity, face heightened vulnerability from land-grabbing and extractive industries, despite their traditional knowledge enhancing resilience. The resolution stressed the need for urgent EU-led climate action, including increased adaptation financing, technology transfers, debt relief for developing countries, and integration of gender-responsive policies. It called for legal protections for climate-displaced persons, noting the absence of international frameworks, and urged alignment of EU development policies with the SDGs, Paris Agreement, and human rights obligations, prioritizing support for small-scale agriculture, fisheries (threatened by 20-40% biomass declines in tropical regions by 2100), and ecosystem-based adaptation. The EU was urged to address structural drivers of vulnerability, such as poverty and inequality, while scaling up climate resilience efforts in least developed countries, small island states, and conflict-affected regions, ensuring equitable partnerships and upholding the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.",
