It emphasized the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan’s role in driving innovation, job creation, and energy security, while highlighting a funding shortfall, noting required investments of €6 billion for wind, €16 billion for solar, €9 billion for bio-energy, €13 billion for carbon capture and storage (CCS), €7 billion for nuclear fission, and €5 billion for fuel cells and hydrogen over the next decade. The resolution called for at least €2 billion annually from the EU budget beyond FP7 and CIP funding from 2010, urged leveraging €300 million from the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) New Entrants Reserve for CCS and renewables, and stressed the importance of ETS auction revenues post-2013 for climate mitigation. It advocated enhancing the European Investment Bank’s (EIB) role in financing energy projects, prioritizing SME-friendly funding, expanding demonstration projects and basic research, and integrating the Smart Cities Initiative into the SET Plan to promote urban energy efficiency.

It stressed the incomplete implementation of the Third Energy Package, citing persistent market concentration, inadequate consumer switching (noted in only 16 Member States committed to smart meter rollouts by 2020), and insufficient price transparency, urging stricter enforcement of consumer rights, including free and rapid supplier switching, bans on aggressive marketing, and accessible digital tools for disabled users. The resolution advocated defining \"prosumers\" as active consumers producing renewable energy individually or collectively, proposing legal frameworks for self-generation, storage, fair grid access, and simplified permitting to boost citizen-led energy cooperatives, while addressing financial barriers through EU funds like EIB and Horizon 2020. It highlighted energy poverty as a critical challenge, calling for a common EU definition, targeted efficiency measures in building renovations (notably under EPBD and EED Article 7), social tariffs, and dedicated EU funding for vulnerable households. Smart technologies, dynamic pricing (on an opt-in basis), and data protection were underscored as essential for empowering consumers, alongside strict compliance with privacy rules for energy data. The resolution urged revising market design to ensure fair grid tariffs, phase out regulated prices cautiously, and promote transparent billing with clear per-kWh costs, while demanding an EU action plan on energy poverty by mid-2017 and enhanced coordination to share best practices among Member States.",

High energy prices, driven by fragmented markets and rising taxes, alongside carbon costs under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), have eroded competitiveness, leading to plant closures and dependency on imports. The resolution stressed the strategic importance of base metals—including steel, aluminum, copper, and rare earths—for downstream industries like automotive, aerospace, and renewable energy, warning against new dependencies. It called for urgent ETS reforms, including free allowances for the 10% most efficient installations in carbon-leakage sectors by 2021–2030, harmonized compensation for indirect energy costs at the EU level, and investments in low-carbon technologies like carbon capture and renewable energy. The Parliament emphasized the need for robust trade defense instruments against dumping and unfair subsidies, referencing global overcapacity and advocating for streamlined anti-dumping investigations. It highlighted the circular economy’s potential, urging incentives for metal recycling and stricter waste legislation, while stressing the role of international climate agreements, particularly the Paris Agreement, to level the playing field. The resolution also underscored the importance of energy market integration, long-term electricity contracts for industry, and skills retention to preserve industrial know-how, noting that 65% of EU business R&D spending originates in manufacturing. Transparency in carbon accounting and the use of ETS revenues, alongside diplomatic efforts to secure raw material supplies, were also prioritized.",

Key amendments included inserting new recitals (e.g., 2a, 2b, 13a) and revising existing ones to clarify objectives such as enhancing transparency, accountability, and alignment with EU strategic priorities. Substantive changes were made to Articles 4, 5, 7, 16, 19, 20, 71, 83, 122, 128, 159, and 171, among others, focusing on governance frameworks, funding allocation criteria, monitoring mechanisms, and stakeholder engagement. The resolution emphasized reinforcing safeguards for compliance, expanding reporting requirements for member states, and integrating sustainability and innovation benchmarks. It called on the Commission to revise its proposal accordingly under Article 293(2) TFEU and urged the Council to consult Parliament again if intending substantial deviations, ensuring alignment with legislative priorities and Treaty obligations.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised significant concerns regarding the safety and geopolitical implications of the Ostrovets nuclear power plant in Belarus, located 50 km from Vilnius and near Poland, Latvia, and Estonia. It highlighted persistent safety deficiencies, including emergency shutdowns, equipment failures (e.g., four voltage transformers, cooling system malfunctions), and eight incidents during construction, two involving the reactor pressure vessel. Despite a 2018 EU peer review identifying numerous safety gaps and recommendations, Belarus delayed cooperation with the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG) until June 2020 under EU pressure, publishing a National Action Plan in August 2019. The plant began generating electricity in November 2020 without an operating license, prompting Baltic States to halt electricity trade. Parliament criticized the rushed commissioning, lack of transparency, and non-compliance with IAEA standards, urging Belarus to fully implement ENSREG recommendations and the Espoo Convention on transboundary environmental impacts. It stressed the need for an independent regulator, given concerns about political pressure on Belarus’s regulatory authority, and called for urgent completion of ENSREG’s ongoing peer review, including site visits and a preliminary report before the plant’s planned commercial start in March 2021. Parliament also emphasized accelerating the synchronization of Baltic electricity grids with the EU network to prevent reliance on the BRELL system and urged measures to block Ostrovets-produced electricity from entering the EU market until safety standards are met, underscoring solidarity with affected citizens and the strategic importance of EU engagement.",

It emphasizes synergies with EU policies, including the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals, and allocates 25% of EU Recovery Instrument funds to health, digital, climate-energy-mobility clusters, and the EIC. Key operational objectives include fostering open science, gender equality, international cooperation, and responsible innovation, while enhancing industrial transformation and risk finance access. Governance structures include independent Scientific and EIC Boards to ensure scientific excellence and innovation-driven strategies, with work programmes adopted via transparent procedures.
