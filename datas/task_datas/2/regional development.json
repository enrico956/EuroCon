It called for leveraging existing programs like MED and ENPI, integrating the Union for the Mediterranean (UFM) and Adriatic-Ionian Initiative (AII), and addressing post-Arab Spring challenges through poverty reduction, fair trade, and democratic governance. Specific priorities included promoting south-south trade, reducing tariffs, and creating regional markets, alongside educational initiatives like a \"Euro-Mediterranean Erasmus\" and \"Leonardo da Vinci\" program to combat brain drain and strengthen cultural and academic exchanges. The resolution also underscored the role of islands under Article 174 TFEU, advocating for measures to mitigate their structural disadvantages in transport and energy. It urged synergies between EU policies, civil society engagement, and compliance with human rights principles, while highlighting the Adriatic-Ionian macro-region’s role in EU enlargement and reconciliation in the Western Balkans.",

It stressed inclusivity for all Atlantic coastal regions, including Macaronesia’s outermost regions, and advocated for a bottom-up approach involving local authorities, stakeholders, and civil society. The strategy’s external dimension was noted for its geopolitical relevance in trade and security, while internal coordination with EU policies (e.g., maritime, energy, transport) was deemed critical. Simplified rules, multi-level governance, and the use of tools like the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) were recommended to streamline implementation from 2014 onward, aligned with the next multiannual financial framework. The Parliament urged the Commission to prioritize synergies across policies, ensure efficient fund allocation, and maintain regular consultation with Parliament during strategy development.",

It emphasized the need to address risks of decommitment under Article 136(1) of the Common Provisions Regulation, urging the Commission to analyze payment forecasts and propose measures to prevent fund losses. The resolution highlighted persistent obstacles from the 2007-2013 period, including complex procurement, state aid rules, and administrative bottlenecks, and called for simplified procedures, strengthened administrative capacity, and better use of financial instruments to leverage private investment. It stressed the importance of fulfilling ex-ante conditionalities by 2016 to avoid payment suspensions and urged alignment with EU priorities like the Energy Union and digital single market. The Parliament welcomed the Commission’s Task Force for Better Implementation in eight Member States but demanded accelerated action and transparency. It advocated combining ESI Funds with the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) to enhance impact, urged flexibility under the Stability and Growth Pact to address liquidity shortages, and highlighted the need for decentralized governance through tools like Integrated Territorial Investment. The resolution also called for improved communication to raise public awareness of Cohesion Policy’s benefits and urged early planning for post-2020 reforms to enhance efficiency and targeting.",

The resolution underscored cohesion policy’s role in reducing regional disparities, fostering growth, and supporting smart, sustainable, and inclusive investments through the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds), particularly the European Social Fund (ESF), which allocates 20% of its resources to social inclusion. It called for improved visibility via digital platforms, social media, and localized campaigns, while advocating for mandatory communication components in project applications and dedicated funding for communication within technical assistance. The Parliament highlighted the partnership principle and multi-level governance as vital for stakeholder engagement, urging better involvement of civil society, local authorities, and social partners. It recommended post-2020 reforms to streamline regulations, strengthen urban-rural cooperation, and ensure long-term evaluation of projects, including extended communication efforts post-project closure. The resolution also urged the Commission to analyze cohesion policy’s broader economic benefits, such as externalities in EU-15 countries from V4 investments, and to promote initiatives like the RegioStars awards to showcase successful projects. Finally, it stressed balancing administrative simplification with financial accountability and addressing gaps in media coverage to rebuild public trust in EU solidarity mechanisms.",

The resolution called for enhanced coordination of EU policies impacting urban areas, including cohesion funds, with at least 5% of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) allocated to integrated sustainable urban development through tools like Integrated Territorial Investments (ITIs) and Community-Led Local Development (CLLD). It urged territorial impact assessments for EU legislation, improved data collection via the Urban Audit, and multi-level governance involving cities in policymaking, including a proposed EU urban coordinator and regular urban summits. The Parliament stressed alignment with the Europe 2020 strategy, smart growth, and international frameworks like the UN’s Habitat III agenda, while advocating for cross-sectoral synergies between funding programs, reduced regulatory burdens, and pilot projects to test integrated solutions for challenges such as energy efficiency, mobility, and social exclusion.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns and outlined key points regarding the use of financial instruments (FIs) and grants in EU Cohesion Policy, emphasizing their roles in addressing regional disparities and achieving Europe 2020 objectives. It noted that ESI Funds investments totaled EUR 347.6 billion (2007-2013) and EUR 454 billion (2014-2020), rising to EUR 637 billion with national co-financing. FI allocations under ERDF, CF, and ESF nearly doubled from EUR 11.7 billion (2007-2013) to EUR 20.9 billion (2014-2020), representing 6% of cohesion policy funds. The Cohesion Fund’s allocation increased to EUR 75 billion (2014-2020), supporting regions housing 34% of the EU population. While grants remain vital for non-revenue projects (e.g., public infrastructure, social services), FIs offer leverage and revolving benefits but face challenges like administrative complexity, delayed implementation, and lower-than-expected private capital mobilization. The Parliament highlighted divergent FI performance across Member States, citing issues from the 2007-2013 period, such as low disbursement rates and high management costs. It urged simplification of state aid rules, better synergies between ESI Funds and instruments like EFSI and Horizon 2020, and enhanced technical assistance for local authorities. The resolution stressed maintaining a balanced mix of grants and FIs tailored to regional needs, avoiding one-size-fits-all approaches, and ensuring FIs complement rather than replace grants, particularly in agriculture and rural development, where grants remain critical for small farms and rural SMEs. It called for improved transparency, harmonized reporting, and measures to address implementation delays, warning against allowing migration, security, or political developments to undermine cohesion goals. The EIB’s role was acknowledged, with EUR 147 billion lent for cohesion (2007-2013), and further collaboration was urged to optimize FI use while safeguarding democratic oversight and regional cohesion priorities.",
