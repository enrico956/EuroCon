It noted the ECB’s monetary policy actions, including two interest rate hikes (25 basis points each in April and August 2011) followed by two reductions (25 basis points each in November and December 2011), and the launch of three-year Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) totaling over €1 trillion (€489.2 billion in December 2011 and €529.5 billion in February 2012) to stabilize financial markets. Despite these efforts, credit growth to the private sector slowed sharply (from 1.6% in 2010 to 0.4% in 2011), inflation rose to 2.7% (driven by energy prices), and government debt increased to 88% of GDP. The resolution acknowledged the ECB’s Securities Markets Programme (SMP), which temporarily reduced borrowing costs for struggling states, but criticized structural shortcomings, including risks from transferring sovereign and bank liabilities to the ECB’s balance sheet (now over 30% of eurozone GDP) and excessive reliance on non-marketable collateral (23% of total). It urged greater transparency, including publication of collateral details, voting records, and SMP bond purchase prices, and called for conditional lending to boost SME credit, which employs 72% of the workforce. The Parliament stressed the urgency of a banking union with a single supervisory mechanism (SSM), resolution authority, and deposit guarantees, while safeguarding against conflicts between monetary and supervisory roles. It criticized the ECB’s lack of gender parity in leadership and insufficient accountability of the Troika, demanding enhanced parliamentary oversight. Finally, the resolution emphasized the need for growth-oriented policies, fiscal consolidation, and Treaty revisions to address institutional gaps and reinforce democratic accountability in ECB operations.",

It advocated voluntary cross-border DGS or linkages between national schemes to enhance the internal market, with supervision by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in cooperation with national authorities. The resolution stressed the importance of aligning DGS operational areas with the economic costs of bank failures, ensuring balanced and stable cross-border schemes, and facilitating depositor access to foreign credit institution branches. It highlighted cooperation between national DGS to streamline depositor interactions and enable voluntary cross-border credit provision.

The resolution called for stricter enforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), introducing an Excessive Debt Surveillance Procedure (EDSP) to monitor debt sustainability, contingent liabilities (e.g., pensions), and fiscal consolidation timelines, aiming to realign deficits with SGP rules by 2015. It advocated for a \"European Semester\" to synchronize national budgetary and reform plans (SCPs and NRPs) with EU oversight, enhanced transparency, and involvement of national parliaments. To address crises, it proposed a permanent European stabilisation mechanism (e.g., a European Monetary Fund) based on existing tools, alongside feasibility studies for common EU bonds. Other measures included tax policy coordination to combat fraud, reinforced Eurostat powers to audit national statistics, and harmonized budget reporting. The resolution urged institutional reforms, such as consolidating Commission roles, improving Euro Group accountability, and exploring Treaty changes for deeper integration, while safeguarding ECB independence and balancing fiscal discipline with investments in cohesion, innovation, and social protections.",

The resolution highlighted the role of multinational companies in exploiting tax disparities, noting that 25% of large US firms and a third of major UK corporations paid no taxes in specific years, while French firms paid 8% effective tax rates versus 33% official rates. It called for extending EU savings taxation rules (Directive 2003/48/EC) to jurisdictions like Singapore, Hong Kong, and US states, ending derogations for Austria, Belgium, and Luxembourg, and accelerating anti-fraud agreements with Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Switzerland. The Parliament stressed improving OECD standards to mandate automatic multilateral information exchange globally, revising accounting rules for country-by-country tax disclosures, and creating an EU public register for entities in tax havens. It advocated a common EU corporate tax base to address transfer pricing, urged sanctions like levies on non-cooperative jurisdictions, and emphasized support for developing countries in building transparent tax systems. The resolution also demanded annual Commission reports on progress, starting in 2010, and highlighted the need to align EU policies with G20, UN, and OECD efforts while addressing loopholes and ensuring fair tax competition.",

It called for a banking union with a single supervisory mechanism to oversee credit institutions, prevent regulatory arbitrage, and manage failing banks, alongside deposit guarantees, stress-testing, and a unified prudential framework. The resolution stressed the necessity of a fiscal union with binding economic policy coordination, a redemption fund to manage debt, and increased EU budgetary capacity funded by own resources like a financial transaction tax (FTT) to address structural imbalances. It demanded greater parliamentary involvement in EU governance, including the European Parliament’s role in drafting the Annual Growth Survey, Economic Policy Guidelines, and oversight of the Eurogroup and European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Social priorities included a \"Social Pact for Europe\" with a youth guarantee to combat 22% youth unemployment (exceeding 50% in some states), minimum unemployment allowances, decent wages, affordable housing, and universal healthcare. The resolution highlighted the need to align national budgets with EU2020 targets, address macroeconomic imbalances, and integrate employment and social policies into economic governance, noting that EU27 unemployment had risen to 10.4% (25 million) by 2012. It urged completion of the internal market, structural reforms to boost competitiveness, and mobilization of 1% of GDP for sustainable investments, while rejecting austerity measures that undermine social protection and cohesion. Democratic accountability measures included transparency in Eurogroup decisions, regular hearings for EU officials, and enhanced roles for national parliaments in fiscal planning.",

Concerns were raised about shadow banking (40% of the EU financial system in 2017), FinTech’s regulatory gaps, and the ECB’s dual role as monetary and supervisory authority, advocating clearer separation. The Parliament welcomed the Euro Summit’s agreement to reform the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) as the Single Resolution Fund’s backstop and urged harmonizing insolvency rules and crisis management tools.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over tax disparities between traditional and digital companies, proposing to increase the Digital Services Tax (DST) rate from 3% to 5% to address the gap between traditional firms’ effective average tax rate of 20.9% and digital multinationals’ negative average tax rate of -2.3%. The adjustment reflects revised metrics, including aligning implied corporate taxes with the 20% rate paid by traditional firms (instead of the proposed 13%) and assuming a more realistic 25% profit margin for digital businesses (versus 15% in the proposal), given that major firms like Facebook and Google exhibit margins up to 40%. The resolution broadened the DST scope to include revenue from digital content (e.g., video, audio, text), e-commerce transactions, and data sales generated through user interaction on digital interfaces, aiming to counter aggressive tax planning by firms lacking physical presence in Member States. It introduced a sunset clause to phase out the DST upon adoption of permanent EU measures like the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) or a digital significant presence framework. The Commission was urged to review the directive after three years, assessing entities covered, tax distribution across Member States, DST thresholds (revenue and entity size), taxable activities, and audit mechanisms requiring triennial audits of DST returns. These measures aim to ensure equitable taxation and adapt to evolving digital business models.",

Unemployment remained alarmingly high at 11.9% in 2013, with youth unemployment exceeding 50% in some states, exacerbating economic divergence. The ECB’s monetary policies, including lowering key interest rates to 0.05% and introducing unconventional measures like targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and asset purchases, were acknowledged for stabilizing financial markets but criticized for failing to spur credit growth, job creation, or inflation, which fell to 0.5% in 2014, far below the 2% target. Private and public investment stagnated at pre-crisis lows, with SMEs facing a 35% lending decline (2008–2013) despite employing 72% of the workforce. Financial fragmentation persisted, with uneven borrowing costs across states, while bank balance sheets remained fragile, highlighted by the ECB’s comprehensive assessment. The resolution stressed the need for structural reforms, growth-friendly fiscal policies, and public investment—such as the proposed €300 billion Juncker plan—to complement ECB actions, warning that prolonged low rates risked distorting markets and undermining savings. It called for enhanced transparency in ECB asset purchases, gender balance in appointments, and a clear separation between monetary policy and banking supervision under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Concerns over deflation risks, unsustainable debt levels (near or above 100% of GDP in many states), and social inequalities linked to austerity were emphasized, alongside calls for labor market reforms that protect workers’ rights and address poverty, which increased by 10 million people (2010–2012). The ECB’s independence and adherence to its price stability mandate were reaffirmed, while its role in the Troika was questioned for overstepping fiscal boundaries.

The resolution defines key terms, including SMEs (up to 499 employees), small mid-cap companies (up to 499 employees, excluding SMEs), mid-cap companies (up to 3,000 employees), and investment platforms as vehicles for pooling resources across sectors or regions. Eligible projects must demonstrate economic viability, align with EU objectives of smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth, address market gaps, and carry higher risk than typical EIB operations. The EFSI enables the EIB to deploy financial instruments like loans, guarantees, equity participations, and credit enhancements through national promotional banks or investment platforms. Governance provisions include Commission representation on the EFSI Steering Board and EIB Board, an Investment Committee appointed by the Commission, and a European Investment Advisory Hub leveraging existing Commission services. The resolution mandates the Commission to manage the guarantee fund, requires the EIB President to engage with Parliament through hearings and written replies within five weeks, and establishes an information-sharing agreement between Parliament and the EIB. It also emphasizes promoting a transparent pipeline of EU investment projects and empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts for integrating EU Structural Funds with EFSI support via investment platforms.",

The resolution emphasized enhancing transparency and mitigating risks by mandating reporting of SFTs to trade repositories, requiring ESMA to develop technical standards specifying reporting formats, including global legal entity identifiers (LEIs) and unique transaction identifiers. Central banks of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) were exempt from reporting but required to cooperate with authorities upon request. Credit institutions and listed companies must disclose SFT activities in annual reports to inform investors and shareholders. The resolution aligned with FSB’s 2013 framework and 2014 recommendations on collateral haircuts for non-centrally cleared SFTs, urging ESMA to monitor FSB developments and prepare a report by 2016 to assess quantitative impacts and propose a consistent EU framework. Phased implementation of reporting obligations was introduced, considering counterparties’ operational readiness. ESMA was tasked with publishing annual reports on aggregate SFT volumes and overseeing trade repository registration, with a 40-day review period for applications. The Commission was mandated to evaluate the regulation’s effectiveness within 15 months, propose further measures to address leverage and pro-cyclicality, and report on circumvention risks. Delegated acts were authorized to amend exemptions for third-country central banks based on evidence of necessity, ensuring alignment with supervisory needs.",

It called for enhanced support for SMEs, which represent 99% of EU businesses and employ 100 million people, and welcomed the digital euro initiative, stressing privacy and accessibility. Concerns were raised about gender imbalance in ECB leadership (only two women in the 25-member Governing Council), with targets to increase female representation to 40-51% by 2026. The resolution also urged greater transparency, accountability through an interinstitutional agreement, and improved cybersecurity for financial infrastructure, while advocating for the euro’s international role and completion of the banking union.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over outdated international tax rules ill-suited for a digitalized economy, emphasizing the need for reforms to address profit shifting, tax avoidance, and under-taxation of digital businesses. It highlighted that digital companies face an average effective tax rate of 9.5% compared to 23.2% for traditional businesses, exacerbating inequalities and market distortions, particularly disadvantaging SMEs. The resolution urged swift adoption of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework’s two-pillar solution: Pillar One to reallocate taxing rights to market jurisdictions based on user participation and value creation, and Pillar Two to establish a global minimum corporate tax rate (ideally set to deter profit shifting). It stressed the urgency of a multilateral agreement by mid-2021 to prevent fragmented national measures, such as uncoordinated digital services taxes (DSTs), which risk trade disputes and single market fragmentation. The Parliament called for an EU fallback position, including a temporary EU-wide DST by end-2021 if international talks fail, and endorsed a digital levy as a new EU own resource to generate €15-29.25 billion annually from 2023, funding COVID-19 recovery and EU programs. It emphasized harmonized implementation of OECD outcomes, simplification of tax rules to avoid complexity, and stronger EU coordination to ensure fair taxation of multinationals, particularly in market jurisdictions where value is created. The resolution also urged revisiting proposals like the CCCTB and significant digital presence, while safeguarding SMEs from undue burdens and ensuring digital tax revenues contribute equitably to public finances.",
