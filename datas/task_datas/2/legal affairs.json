The resolution called for renegotiating the outdated 2003 Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Lawmaking to align with the Lisbon Treaty, strengthen impact assessments, and enhance cooperation with national parliaments through guidelines, extended deadlines, and transparency measures like publishing responses in the Official Journal. It urged the Commission to prioritize SME-friendly regulations, reduce \"gold-plating,\" and deliver concrete actions under its Regulatory Fitness (REFIT) program, including evaluating the \"Top 10\" burdensome laws and presenting annual progress reports. The Parliament stressed the Court of Justice’s role in reviewing proportionality, citing the 2011 Luxembourg v. EP case, and advocated for independent impact assessments with territorial analyses, updated guidelines by June 2014, and stricter adherence to the \"Think Small First\" principle. It criticized the withdrawal of the \"Monti II\" proposal due to political feasibility rather than subsidiarity concerns and called for systemic reforms to improve democratic legitimacy, multi-level governance, and regulatory efficiency.",

It highlighted a 60% increase in open late-transposition cases (763 in 2011) and the Commission’s first referral of such a case to the Court of Justice with financial sanctions under Article 260(3) TFEU. While 399 infringement cases were resolved through Member State compliance and 85% of Court rulings favored the Commission in 2011, the Parliament criticized the Commission’s reliance on limited data, stressing that statistics underrepresent systemic non-compliance due to resource constraints. It condemned the EU Pilot platform’s lack of legal status and transparency, urging binding regulations under Article 298 TFEU to formalize procedures, ensure complainant participation, and grant Parliament access to anonymized case data for oversight. The resolution called for equal treatment of citizen petitions and Commission complaints, improved transposition of directives, and timely updates on infringement proceedings, particularly in environmental health cases. Emphasizing the need for a \"procedural code\" and enhanced administrative accountability under the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Parliament demanded stronger enforcement tools, public databases for infringement tracking, and closer interinstitutional collaboration to uphold EU law’s credibility.",

It urged allocating at least 25% of levy revenues to promote arts and cultural production, alongside greater transparency in fund distribution.

It recommended cross-border levy collection aligned with CJEU rulings to prevent double payments and urged consumer awareness campaigns on levy purposes.

A second \"yellow card\" in 2013 on the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (13 opinions, 18 votes) saw the Commission maintain the proposal but narrow its scope. The resolution highlighted deficiencies in Commission impact assessments, with 30% deemed insufficient on subsidiarity in 2012-2013, rising to 50% in 2014, and urged revised guidelines. It called for mid-term and post-legislative subsidiarity checks, enhanced political dialogue, and a \"green card\" initiative for national parliaments to propose legislation. Concerns were raised about investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) potentially undermining subsidiarity, alongside calls for clarity on EU-Member State competences in trade agreements and transparency in negotiations. The resolution stressed the need for proportionality in EU financial assistance, simplified EU fund applications, and better integration of national impact assessments. It urged the Commission to address national parliaments’ concerns comprehensively, improve ex-ante evaluations, and foster a \"subsidiarity culture\" through regular debates and exchanges, while underscoring the EU’s exclusive competence in trade policy under Article 3 TFEU.",

The resolution called for legislation covering all large EU and non-EU companies operating in the internal market, including financial services, with proportionate measures for SMEs, and advocated import bans on goods linked to severe abuses like forced labor. It urged harmonization with existing frameworks (e.g., Conflict Minerals Regulation, Timber Regulation) to avoid duplication, while emphasizing traceability, stakeholder engagement, and digital solutions like blockchain. The Parliament demanded corporate liability for harm caused, access to justice for victims (including extraterritorial jurisdiction and *forum necessitatis*), and robust enforcement via national authorities and a European oversight network. It also stressed alignment with international standards (UN Guiding Principles, OECD guidelines), sector-specific due diligence for high-risk industries (e.g., garments, extractives), and support for developing countries through trade policy coherence and technical assistance. The resolution noted that only 37% of businesses currently conduct environmental and human rights due diligence, underscoring the need for legal certainty, a level playing field, and enhanced transparency to protect consumers and promote sustainable governance.",
