The resolution supports abolishing the current EU MFN tariff rate of €176 per tonne for bananas by repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005, aligning with commitments under the Geneva Agreement. It welcomes the conclusion of the WTO dispute as politically and commercially significant, despite not fully reconciling all parties' interests, and affirms that the agreement will finalize EU market access commitments for bananas within the Doha Round agricultural negotiations. The Parliament endorsed the Commission’s proposal at first reading, urging the Commission to re-engage Parliament if substantial amendments arise, and emphasized integrating the outcomes into broader multilateral trade frameworks.",

It emphasized the potential for growth and job creation through a comprehensive trade agreement targeting the elimination of tariffs, reduction of non-tariff barriers (NTBs), and enhanced regulatory cooperation, citing a 2009 study estimating a €163 billion GDP boost by 2018 if half of NTBs were removed. The resolution advocated for ambitious market access in goods, services, and investment, addressing regulatory divergences in sectors like agriculture (noting geographical indications and export refunds), financial services, public procurement (urging reciprocity), intellectual property, and emerging technologies. It stressed aligning standards to the highest levels while respecting each party’s regulatory autonomy, particularly in sensitive areas like GMOs and public services. The Parliament supported the High-Level Working Group’s (HLWG) interim recommendations for a swift, bold agreement to be negotiated by early 2013, aiming to conclude before the Commission’s term ended, and underscored the need for stakeholder engagement, SME inclusion, and compatibility with WTO rules despite the Doha impasse. It also highlighted spillover benefits for NAFTA countries and global rule-setting, while calling for transatlantic cooperation on cybersecurity, e-commerce, and financial stability to reinforce multilateralism and shared leadership in the global economy.",

Environmental safeguards were deemed inadequate, citing Canada’s history of challenging EU laws (e.g., REACH, pesticides) and CETA’s failure to enshrine the Precautionary Principle, instead aligning with weaker standards like the Codex Alimentarius. The agreement’s promotion of GMO harmonization and fossil fuel imports from Canadian tar sands (undermining the EU’s Fuel Quality Directive) further threatened climate goals. Public services faced risks due to a Negative List approach with standstill and ratchet clauses, constraining future policy flexibility. Social impacts included projected long-term unemployment and inequality, as 2011 assessments indicated redistribution favoring capital owners, while labor provisions lacked enforceable ILO core standards. Agricultural liberalization risked small-scale farmers and animal welfare, with no binding animal welfare rules. Industrial policy concerns centered on prohibitions against local content requirements, hindering green transitions, and inadequate SME support, noting 1% of exporters (large firms) dominate over half of export value. Procurement rules were criticized for cementing restrictive frameworks, limiting green infrastructure investments.

It highlighted the EU’s leadership in PPPs, accounting for over 45% of the global PPP infrastructure market, and stressed the need for internationally recognized definitions, transparent governance, and risk-sharing frameworks to ensure cost-effectiveness, quality public services, and compliance with social, environmental, and human rights standards. The resolution underscored the role of SMEs, advocating for their inclusion through clustered tendering, transparent subcontracting, and support via EU agencies like EASME and EEN, while addressing barriers faced by EU companies in foreign procurement markets through trade agreements and reciprocal market access. It linked PPPs to development goals, urging technical assistance to developing countries for institutional capacity-building, alignment with national development plans, and poverty reduction, alongside safeguards against state indebtedness and corruption. Gender mainstreaming, adherence to UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and corporate accountability were emphasized, alongside calls for blending mechanisms to mobilize private finance and EU initiatives like the European Fund for Strategic Investments to enhance global PPP participation. The Parliament also stressed the need for legal certainty, dispute resolution mechanisms, and alignment with EU procurement directives (2014/24/EU, 2014/25/EU, and 2014/23/EU) to ensure fair competition and long-term viability, projecting a 5% sustainable growth target in developing countries through responsible PPPs.",

It emphasized the WTO’s critical role in maintaining a rules-based multilateral trading system, noting that developing countries now account for 50% of global trade (up from 33% in 2000) and extreme poverty has halved since 1990 to under one billion people. The resolution called for reforms to address the Doha Development Agenda’s stagnation, including revising special and differential treatment (S&DT) to better reflect countries’ economic realities, advancing plurilateral agreements on environmental goods and services, and ensuring alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement. It welcomed the 2017 Trade Facilitation Agreement (ratified by two-thirds of WTO members) as a model for future deals but urged full implementation, particularly by African nations. Criticizing U.S. steel/aluminum tariffs as WTO-inconsistent and China’s non-compliance with national treatment principles, the resolution stressed the need for transparency, gender equality in trade, digital infrastructure investment, and stronger parliamentary oversight. It advocated for binding environmental and labor standards, carbon border adjustments, and safeguarding food security and access to medicines through TRIPS flexibilities, while warning against bilateral agreements undermining multilateralism. The EU was urged to lead reforms, collaborate with major trading partners, and resolve the Appellate Body crisis to restore the WTO’s dispute settlement function.",
