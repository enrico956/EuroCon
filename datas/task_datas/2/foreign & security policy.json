It urged implementation of OSCE/ODIHR recommendations on elections, judicial independence, anti-corruption measures (noting impunity for high-level corruption), and media freedom, including decriminalizing libel. The resolution highlighted human rights concerns, including domestic violence, trafficking, discrimination against minorities (notably Roma), and LGBTQ+ rights, urging full enforcement of anti-discrimination laws and the 2011 census for accurate data. Economically, it noted growth but stressed poverty reduction, formalizing the labor market, and improving infrastructure, energy diversification (renewables), and environmental sustainability. It welcomed visa liberalization efforts targeting a 2010 waiver, regional cooperation, and IPA funding, while underscoring challenges in property rights, public administration politicization, and prison conditions. The resolution called for cross-party consensus on reforms, civil society engagement, and alignment with EU standards across sectors to advance integration.",

The Parliament underscored the urgency of meeting the Helsinki Headline Goal (deploying 60,000 troops in 60 days) and closing capability shortfalls through initiatives like the European Defence Agency (EDA), including joint ownership of strategic assets and increased EU funding for defence research. It advocated for stronger EU-NATO cooperation, interoperability, and streamlined multinational structures, while urging Member States to advance permanent structured cooperation under the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen collective defence commitments. The resolution also emphasized the importance of satellite programs (Copernicus, Galileo) and cyber defence strategies, alongside proposals to enhance training, exercises, and education under a common European framework. Finally, it called for political will to implement these measures ahead of the December 2013 European Council on defence, ensuring the EU’s credibility as a global security actor.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised support for Croatia’s EU accession, acknowledging significant progress in meeting negotiation benchmarks, with negotiations expected to conclude in the first half of 2011 pending sustained reforms. Key priorities included strengthening public administration, judiciary independence, anti-corruption efforts (noting high-profile cases involving a former Prime Minister and ministers), resolving ICTY cooperation gaps, ensuring refugee return sustainability, finalizing shipyard restructuring, and improving transparency in media and civil society engagement. Concerns were highlighted over public skepticism, with only a minority of citizens viewing EU membership favorably, urging enhanced outreach. Constitutional reforms in June 2010 were praised but critiqued for omitting protections for LGBT rights and ecological sustainability. Judicial reforms reduced case backlogs but faced resource shortages, with 25% of parliamentary seats held by women, though gender wage gaps persisted. Regional cooperation was emphasized, including resolving border disputes with Slovenia (via a 2010 arbitration agreement), Serbia, and Bosnia, alongside reconciliation efforts such as joint visits to war sites and extradition agreements. Economic challenges included GDP contraction, labor market rigidity, and fragmented agricultural sectors, requiring structural reforms. Environmental and transport infrastructure alignment with EU standards was urged, alongside Croatia’s participation in CSDP missions like EU NAVFOR Atalanta. The resolution stressed that Croatia’s accession should incentivize Western Balkan neighbors to pursue reforms, underscoring the need for continued post-accession reforms to maximize EU benefits.",

It highlighted the importance of UN Security Council resolutions (1814 to 1972, 2008–2009) enabling international intervention in Somali waters and stressed the need for legal frameworks, including agreements with Kenya (2008) and Seychelles (2009), to transfer and prosecute suspected pirates. The resolution emphasized addressing root causes of piracy by supporting Somalia’s political stability, referencing the Djibouti Peace Agreement’s call for a unity government and inclusive parliament. It urged enhanced regional cooperation, comprehensive counter-piracy strategies, and sustained EU engagement to safeguard maritime routes and civilian lives while aligning military efforts with long-term governance and development goals in Somalia.",

It strongly condemned the 23 November 2009 Maguindanao massacre, where 57 people, including 30 journalists and female relatives of a political candidate, were brutally murdered by a militia linked to the Ampatuan family, exposing systemic corruption, impunity, and collusion between local warlords and security forces. While acknowledging the government’s declaration of martial law in Maguindanao and arrests of key suspects, the resolution criticized delays in investigations, inadequate crime-scene analysis, and potential bias due to political ties between officials and the Ampatuan family. It called for urgent witness protection, independent prosecutions, international forensic and legal assistance, and the disbanding of paramilitary groups, urging revocation of Executive Order 546 permitting militia forces.

It condemned ongoing human rights violations, including the use of tear gas, stun grenades, and birdshot in residential areas, and highlighted over 100 recent arbitrary detentions, unfair trials, and the imprisonment of activists like Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and Mahdi Abu Dheeb. The resolution urged Bahrain to fully implement BICI recommendations, ensure accountability for abuses, release all peaceful protesters, and drop charges based on confessions or free expression. It noted systemic discrimination, including over 4,000 dismissals linked to protests, with 1,000 still not reinstated, and criticized restrictions on journalists and human rights organizations. While welcoming Bahrain’s establishment of a human rights ministry and investigatory unit, the Parliament stressed slow progress on reforms, including unresolved military court cases and delayed UN visits. It called for independent investigations into abuses, reinstatement of dismissed workers, an end to internet censorship, and a moratorium on the death penalty. The resolution also urged EU member states to halt arms exports that could facilitate repression, aligning with the U.S. suspension, and emphasized the need for inclusive dialogue to address democratic aspirations and ensure rights compliance.",

The resolution highlighted risks such as system malfunctions due to flawed code or cyberattacks and cited widespread opposition, including open letters from over 3,000 AI researchers, 116 robotics company founders, and pledges by 240 organizations and 3,089 individuals to reject LAWS. It urged the EU and member states to adopt a unified position ahead of the November 2018 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons meeting, prioritizing negotiations for a legally binding international ban on LAWS development and use. The Parliament clarified that existing EU defense systems, including automated defenses against missiles or aircraft, do not qualify as LAWS, but insisted human operators must retain control over engagement decisions involving human-inhabited targets. It reiterated calls for the EU to lead global disarmament efforts, align defense funding programs with prohibitions on LAWS, and uphold human dignity, peace, and security through strict adherence to international law.",

It emphasized strict adherence to the legally binding Common Position 2008/944/CFSP, which outlines eight criteria for arms exports, including preventing internal repression and preserving regional stability, but criticized inconsistent application by member states, lax enforcement, and the absence of penalties for violations. The resolution called for enhanced transparency, including standardized reporting of export licenses and actual deliveries, and urged stricter controls on dual-use technologies, arms brokering, and diversion risks. It welcomed the UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) but highlighted gaps in enforcement and universal compliance. The Parliament advocated for establishing an independent European Arms Control Authority (EACA) to assess export licenses, align criteria with the ATT, and address loopholes in third-country production. It also stressed the need to prevent arms transfers to conflict zones like Ukraine, Syria, and Yemen, and highlighted the humanitarian consequences of illicit arms flows, including approximately 500,000 annual deaths from armed violence. The resolution urged coherence between EU defense exports and human rights priorities, stricter monitoring of end-users, and alignment of development policies to reduce arms-driven instability in vulnerable regions.",

The resolution called for enhanced cooperation, pooled procurement via the European Defence Agency (EDA), and stricter compliance with EU arms export controls to prevent technology leaks. It stressed the need for a robust European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) through cross-border collaboration, dual-use research, SME inclusion, and phasing out unjustified offsets. The Parliament urged the Commission to enforce defense market rules, monitor national transpositions, and develop an EU-wide security-of-supply regime, while advocating for cybersecurity coordination and reforms to streamline procurement processes under Horizon 2020 and other EU funds. It highlighted the urgency of addressing growing reliance on non-EU defense exports and foreign investments, which risk compromising strategic assets and Europe’s ability to respond to crises through the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).",

It stressed that data transfers to third countries must ensure a level of protection \"essentially equivalent\" to EU law, as mandated by the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While welcoming improvements in the Privacy Shield over Safe Harbour—such as clearer definitions, oversight mechanisms, and mandatory compliance reviews—the resolution highlighted unresolved issues, including US bulk data collection under Presidential Policy Directive 28, which lacks strict necessity and proportionality under EU standards. It noted SMEs, representing 60% of Safe Harbour users, require legal certainty for transatlantic operations, given the economic significance of US-EU trade (USD 1.09 trillion in 2014) and cross-border data flows (50% higher than US-Asia flows). Criticisms included the insufficient independence and authority of the US Ombudsperson for handling surveillance complaints and the complexity of redress mechanisms for individuals. The Parliament urged the Commission to address deficiencies, seek clarifications on US legal assurances, fully implement recommendations from the Article 29 Working Party, and conduct periodic reviews of the Privacy Shield’s adequacy, particularly after the GDPR’s full application. It called for continued dialogue to strengthen data privacy, trade, and security frameworks while balancing fundamental rights and law enforcement needs.",

It highlighted deficiencies in the Privacy Shield Principles, including the absence of mandatory data subject consent, lack of data minimization requirements, and permission for incompatible data processing purposes. Enforcement mechanisms were deemed insufficient, with a burdensome five-step redress process for individuals and weak penalties for non-compliance, such as mere removal from the Privacy Shield list. The resolution criticized US government surveillance practices, noting that bulk data collection under Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28) and retention for up to five years violated EU necessity and proportionality standards, as affirmed in the Schrems judgment. It also found the ombudsperson role inadequate due to lack of independence and inability to confirm remedies or surveillance targeting. The Parliament warned that PPD-28’s non-legislative status created legal uncertainty, as it could be revoked unilaterally, and noted ongoing US legislative changes, like Rule 41 amendments, further eroding privacy. While acknowledging improvements over Safe Harbour, the resolution concluded the Privacy Shield failed to address core issues, risking legal challenges and market distortions favoring US companies. It urged the Commission to negotiate stronger safeguards, include a two-year sunset clause, and initiate infringement proceedings against Member States adopting non-compliant surveillance laws.",

The Parliament demanded the immediate release of political prisoners, including José Daniel Ferrer, and called for independent UN investigations, fair trials, and dialogue to address citizens’ demands for democracy, economic reform, and COVID-19 response. It further criticized Cuba’s exclusion of civil society from EU cooperation projects and urged support for human rights defenders, Sakharov Prize laureates, and access for international monitors.",

The resolution highlighted economic collapse (45% GDP contraction since 2015), diversion of $1.8 billion in public funds by Houthis and $423 million by the government, and the imminent environmental disaster from the decaying FSO Safer oil tanker. It urged an EU-wide arms embargo on Saudi Arabia and the UAE, citing breaches of international law, and welcomed the US halt to offensive support and revocation of Houthi terrorist designation. The Parliament called for unhindered humanitarian access, COVID-19 vaccine equity via COVAX, and sustained funding to address the $3.38 billion aid gap (56% met in 2020). It demanded accountability through ICC referral, sanctions under the EU Global Human Rights Regime, and support for UN-led peace efforts, including the Stockholm Agreement and ceasefire initiatives. The resolution emphasized inclusive political dialogue with women’s participation, condemned foreign interference (Iranian arms to Houthis, UAE/Saudi roles), and stressed protection of cultural heritage, press freedom, and religious minorities, including Baha’i detainees.",

It condemned the coup, demanded Kaboré’s unconditional release, and stressed the urgent need to restore constitutional order through inclusive, transparent elections and civilian governance. The resolution highlighted severe security challenges, including jihadist attacks causing over 1.6 million internally displaced persons (a 50% increase in 2021), 1,000 closed schools, and deadly incidents like the June 2021 Solhan attack (174 deaths) and the November 2021 Inata attack (53 soldiers killed). It criticized rampant corruption and mismanagement of defense spending, which rose from €240 million to €650 million (2016–2021) without improving military effectiveness or living conditions. The Parliament urged EU and international support for humanitarian aid, judicial and security sector reforms, and accountability for human rights abuses, including summary executions by security forces. It called for revising the immunity clause for Burkina Faso’s special forces to ensure justice for victims and emphasized addressing root causes of instability, such as climate-driven displacement, poverty, and governance failures. The resolution expressed alarm over regional democratic backsliding, citing four West African coups in two years, and opposed the involvement of Russia’s Wagner Group, warning it undermines peace efforts. It endorsed ECOWAS and AU mediation, advocating clear transition timelines, civil society dialogue, and adherence to international commitments, including SDGs and human rights frameworks.",

The resolution demanded full implementation of the Minsk Agreements, de-escalation, and withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine’s territories. It strongly condemned the politically motivated imprisonment, torture, and life-threatening treatment of Alexei Navalny, urging his immediate release, accountability for his poisoning, and sanctions against those responsible. The Parliament highlighted systemic human rights abuses in Russia, including over 15,000 detentions of protesters since January 2021, and denounced the designation of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation as “extremist.” It expressed solidarity with the Czech Republic following revelations of Russian GRU involvement in a 2014 ammunition depot explosion that killed two citizens, endorsing coordinated diplomatic responses. The resolution called for halting Nord Stream 2, reducing EU energy dependence on Russia, and imposing severe sanctions—including SWIFT exclusion and energy import bans—in case of further aggression. It urged enhanced EU-Ukraine security cooperation, support for defensive arms supplies, and adoption of an EU anti-corruption sanctions regime targeting illicit Russian wealth. The Parliament emphasized unity among Member States, cooperation with NATO and the US, and a new EU strategy for Russia prioritizing civil society engagement, human rights, and accountability for violations of international law.",

The Parliament condemned harsh prison sentences for activists, including Abdurahman al-Sadhan (20 years for critical tweets) and Mohammed al-Otaibi (17 years for advocacy), and restrictions on released women’s rights defenders like Loujain al-Hathloul. It called for suspending EU exports of surveillance technology used for repression, applying the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, and holding Saudi Arabia accountable for Jamal Khashoggi’s murder, referencing the Callamard Report implicating Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The resolution urged Saudi Arabia to ratify key treaties like the ICCPR, investigate torture allegations, ensure fair trials, and cooperate with UN mechanisms, while pressing the EU to prioritize human rights in dialogues and support UN initiatives, including a potential Special Rapporteur on Saudi Arabia.",

It called for climate-proofing CSDP missions, proposing a pilot emissions-tracking project for EUFOR Althea, and enhancing conflict-sensitive climate adaptation in vulnerable regions like the Sahel, Arctic, and Horn of Africa, where resource scarcity fuels instability. The Parliament advocated for climate security expertise in missions, cooperation with NATO and the UN on emissions reduction methodologies, and addressing environmental crimes, which generate $258 billion annually. It underscored the unmet $100 billion climate finance pledge to developing nations and urged inclusive, gender-sensitive approaches, linking climate resilience to peacebuilding and human security. The resolution also emphasized green defense innovation, electrification of military systems, and circular economy principles in procurement, supported by the EDF’s €133 million annual investment in sustainable technologies.",

It urged Kenya to halt camp closures until regional stability is achieved, ensure voluntary, safe repatriation, and enhance camp security, while stressing the EU’s responsibility to resettle refugees, particularly LGBTIQ+ individuals, and increase humanitarian aid, including €15 million allocated in 2021 and €45 million via the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa since 2016. The Parliament called for equitable COVID-19 vaccine access (noting only 3% of Kenyans were fully vaccinated and 2,000 doses allocated to Kakuma), adherence to international law, and collaboration with the UNHCR on the agreed June 2022 camp closure roadmap. It emphasized addressing root causes of displacement in the Horn of Africa, including conflict, climate crises, and poverty, and urged the EU to leverage its LGBTIQ+ Equality Strategy and Toolkit to advocate for decriminalization across Africa, while ensuring development funds prioritize human rights, refugee integration, and sustainable solutions aligned with the Global Compact on Refugees.",

The resolution denounced Cuba’s suppression of the planned 15 November 2021 civic march, revocation of EFE journalists’ credentials to stifle press freedom, and persistent breaches of the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement (PDCA), particularly violations of human rights obligations under Articles 1(5), 2(c), 5, 22, and 43(2). It urged immediate release of all political prisoners, independent investigations into abuses, access for UN human rights rapporteurs, and guarantees for freedoms of expression, assembly, and fair trials. The Parliament called on the EU to trigger the PDCA’s suspension clause (Article 85(3)(b)) due to Cuba’s failure to uphold democratic principles, and urged sanctions against officials responsible for repression. It stressed the need for Cuba to align with international human rights standards, ensure economic and social rights, and engage civil society in dialogue, while condemning forced expatriations and restrictions on EU delegations and civil society monitoring. The resolution underscored deteriorating human rights conditions despite the PDCA’s provisional application since 2017 and demanded urgent reforms to address systemic repression.",

The resolution condemned extreme gang violence, citing over 1,000 civilian and 45 police deaths between 2015-2017, which fueled forced displacement. It criticized inhumane prison practices under Extraordinary Security Measures, including prolonged isolation and suspended family visits. The Parliament strongly rejected the imprisonment of women and girls for stillbirths or miscarriages, referencing 147 women charged (2000-2014) and 49 convicted, including Evelyn Hernández Cruz’s 30-year sentence and Teodora Vásquez’s decade-long imprisonment. It demanded immediate release of such women, fair trials, and safeguards for healthcare confidentiality. The resolution urged anti-corruption measures, including adopting international instruments like the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, and called for monitoring mechanisms to enforce laws against discrimination and abuse of pregnant girls. It pressed for enhanced efforts to combat gang violence, protect human rights defenders and journalists, and improve prison conditions by ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. The EU was urged to increase support for Salvadoran NGOs advocating women’s rights.",

Over 8,000 deaths (60% civilians) and 50,000 injuries since 2015 were noted, alongside EU member states’ continued arms exports to Saudi Arabia, violating EU Common Position 2008/944/CFSP. The resolution demanded an immediate ceasefire, unrestricted humanitarian access, and accountability for war crimes, urging the EU to push for UN-led peace talks and an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia.

The Parliament also condemned Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia, Iran’s support for Houthi forces, and exploitation of instability by terrorist groups (AQAP, ISIS), while calling for protection of civilians, journalists, and accountability through UN investigations.",

        "stance": "ALDE strongly agrees the issue’s suspension of EU macro-financial assistance until Moldova guarantees credible elections, aligning perfectly with ALDE’s commitment to democratic integrity and popular sovereignty.  \nALDE entirely supports the condemnation of judicial manipulation in annulling Chișinău’s election results, reflecting ALDE’s unwavering stance on judicial independence and rule of law.  \nALDE applauds the focus on systemic flaws, including politicized prosecutions and electoral law deficiencies, which resonate with ALDE’s 2023 manifesto priorities for governance accountability.  \nALDE proposes amending the suspension clause to specify measurable benchmarks for judicial reform, such as public vetting of politically appointed judges, to strengthen transparency.  \nALDE underscores the urgency of safeguarding civil society freedoms, urging explicit inclusion of NGO protections in line with the EU-Moldova Association Agreement’s democratic values."

        "stance": "SD rejects the suspension of EU financial assistance as fundamentally againsting with S&D's commitment to direct support for Moldovan citizens over punitive government measures.  \nSD opposes linking macro-financial aid to political conditions, viewing this as mirroring the same undemocratic tactics used to invalidate Chișinău's elections.  \nSD condemns the proposed fund cuts as counterproductive to European integration goals, warning this risks pushing Moldova toward Russian influence.  \nSD challenges the issue's punitive approach as inconsistent with S&D's principle of empowering civil society during democratic backsliding.  \nSD rejects the framework of financial coercion, arguing it undermines EU credibility in promoting rule-of-law reforms through partnership."

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised deep concerns over Moldova’s invalidation of the 2018 Chișinău mayoral election results, where Andrei Nastase won 52.57% of votes but courts annulled the outcome citing social media campaigning post-deadline—a practice previously tolerated. It condemned this decision as politically motivated, undermining democratic principles, judicial independence, and public trust, and warned of authoritarian trends. The resolution highlighted systemic issues, including electoral law changes criticized by OSCE/ODIHR and the Venice Commission for risking undue influence, inadequate minority representation, and lack of consensus. It linked Moldova’s democratic backsliding to failures in judiciary reform, politicized prosecutions, and insufficient progress in investigating the 2014 banking fraud ($1 billion loss), urging asset recovery and accountability. The Parliament demanded suspension of EU macro-financial assistance and budgetary support until Moldova meets political conditions, including credible parliamentary elections and judicial reforms. It also criticized restrictive NGO funding proposals, media law reforms threatening pluralism, and harassment of human rights defenders, calling for adherence to the EU-Moldova Association Agreement’s values. The resolution reiterated demands for separation of powers, rule of law, and respect for protests, while noting the EU’s prior withholding of €28 million in justice reform funds due to insufficient progress.",
