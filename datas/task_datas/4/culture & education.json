It emphasized the urgent need to address language barriers hindering cross-border e-commerce (only 16% in 2015) and the fragmented Digital Single Market, urging the EU to prioritize multilingualism through coordinated policies, funding, and research. Key recommendations included establishing large-scale funding programs for language technologies (LTs), particularly AI-driven solutions like deep learning, to ensure equal access for lesser-used languages, support SMEs with automated translation tools, and promote cloud-based, interoperable platforms. The resolution stressed the EU’s responsibility to reduce inequalities by developing multilingual public e-services, enhancing digital literacy in minority languages, and fostering collaboration between academia, industry, and governments. It called for a dedicated EU strategy to preserve linguistic diversity, including financial support for subtitling, translation tools, and keyboard layouts for endangered languages, while emphasizing the cultural and economic benefits of a multilingual digital ecosystem aligned with Horizon 2020 and future research frameworks.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people, exacerbating youth unemployment, educational inequalities, and mental health challenges, while severely disrupting the sports sector. It highlighted that youth unemployment surged due to crises in labor-intensive sectors like retail, tourism, and hospitality, disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups, including NEETs (young people not in education, employment, or training), with gender disparities worsening outcomes. The resolution stressed the digital divide, citing OECD data showing only half of students could access most curricula online, risking long-term skill gaps. It urged increased investment in digital literacy, quality online tools, and teacher training under the Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027), alongside safeguarding in-person learning for marginalized groups. The Parliament called for expanded mental health support, tailored services for disabled youth and rural populations, and rights-based policies to protect vulnerable communities, including migrants and LGBTQI+ individuals. It emphasized the role of youth programs like Erasmus+, the European Solidarity Corps, and Youth Guarantee, advocating for 10% of recovery funds to education and 20% to digital strategies. Regarding sports, the resolution noted the sector’s economic significance (2.12% of EU GDP, 5.67 million jobs) and its societal role in inclusion and health, urging targeted relief for grassroots and professional sports through EU funds like the Recovery and Resilience Facility. It called for coordinated measures to safely resume events, address doping risks, and support clubs facing existential threats, while promoting digital innovation and cross-sector collaboration to enhance resilience. The resolution underscored the need to preserve civic spaces, youth organizations, and the European sport model, emphasizing solidarity and equitable access to mitigate the pandemic’s long-term effects.",

The resolution advocates for enhanced mobility, mutual recognition of qualifications, and synergies between EU programs like Erasmus+, Horizon Europe, and the European Skills Agenda, which aims for 70% of 16-74-year-olds to attain basic digital skills by 2025. It stresses the need to reduce early school leavers to 5% and under-skilled 15-year-olds in core subjects below 10%, while increasing adult learning participation to 50%. The Parliament called for allocating at least 10% of national recovery budgets and increasing public education spending above the EU average of 4.7% of GDP (2019), alongside targeted investments in teacher training, digital infrastructure, and vocational education to address gaps in AI programs and promote dual education systems. The resolution highlights inclusion for vulnerable groups, climate education aligned with the European Green Deal, gender equality in STEAM fields, and combating disinformation through media literacy. It urges governance frameworks like the EEA Strategic Framework 2030 with multi-level collaboration, a European dimension in curricula covering EU history and citizenship, and partnerships with UNESCO and OECD. Key sectoral measures include fostering plurilingualism, recognizing non-formal learning, developing micro-credentials with EU-wide standards, and ensuring face-to-face learning remains central, supplemented by blended approaches. The Parliament also emphasized disaster preparedness for education systems and the role of European Universities and Centres of Vocational Excellence in driving excellence and mobility.",
