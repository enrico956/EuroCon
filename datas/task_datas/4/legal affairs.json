The resolution called for renegotiating the outdated 2003 Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Lawmaking to align with the Lisbon Treaty, strengthen impact assessments, and enhance cooperation with national parliaments through guidelines, extended deadlines, and transparency measures like publishing responses in the Official Journal. It urged the Commission to prioritize SME-friendly regulations, reduce \"gold-plating,\" and deliver concrete actions under its Regulatory Fitness (REFIT) program, including evaluating the \"Top 10\" burdensome laws and presenting annual progress reports. The Parliament stressed the Court of Justice’s role in reviewing proportionality, citing the 2011 Luxembourg v. EP case, and advocated for independent impact assessments with territorial analyses, updated guidelines by June 2014, and stricter adherence to the \"Think Small First\" principle. It criticized the withdrawal of the \"Monti II\" proposal due to political feasibility rather than subsidiarity concerns and called for systemic reforms to improve democratic legitimacy, multi-level governance, and regulatory efficiency.",

The resolution stressed early information-sharing with stakeholders, including dependent SMEs, and mandated training programs (with annual hours set by law or collective agreements) to boost employability, particularly in green and digital sectors. It advocated for EU funds (ERDF, ESF, EGF) to support retraining and regional reconversion, while penalizing non-compliant companies by withholding EU/national funding for five years. Anti-discrimination safeguards, especially against age bias, and psychosocial support for affected workers were highlighted. Public authorities were tasked with facilitating multi-stakeholder dialogues, skill assessments, and industrial site rehabilitation.

Participation among national chambers dropped by 50%, with only 15 chambers submitting opinions. The resolution highlighted deficiencies in Commission impact assessments, with 32% of those reviewed in 2014 lacking adequate subsidiarity or proportionality analysis, and urged the Commission to improve explanatory statements and conduct enhanced proportionality assessments, including environmental, social, and economic impacts. It welcomed the 2015 Better Regulation package, which aimed to strengthen subsidiarity justifications, and supported proposals for a \"green card\" mechanism allowing national parliaments to suggest legislative initiatives, while cautioning against undermining EU institutional processes. The Parliament called for extending the eight-week period for national parliaments to issue reasoned opinions under Protocol No 2, suggested Treaty revisions to expand subsidiarity checks to include proportionality, and stressed the need for interparliamentary cooperation through tools like IPEX and COSAC. It encouraged greater engagement between EU institutions and national parliaments, including informal contacts and shared guidelines, and emphasized the role of the Committee of the Regions in assessing compliance with subsidiarity. The resolution reiterated the importance of clear, proportionate legislation and urged robust EU action where added value is demonstrable, balancing efficiency with democratic accountability.",

It emphasized Member States’ primary responsibility for correct transposition, including providing explanatory documents and correlation tables, while calling for enhanced transparency, a centralized complaint portal, and systematic monitoring of regulations alongside directives. Concerns were raised over austerity measures undermining administrative and judicial capacities, deficient refugee relocation mechanisms, and delays in animal welfare strategies. The Parliament urged codifying EU administrative procedures to strengthen citizens’ rights, improving cooperation with national parliaments to avoid “gold-plating” legislation, and ensuring EU institutions’ compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, particularly in Memoranda of Understanding and stability mechanisms.

It highlighted demographic shifts, increased mobility, and disparities in Member States’ legal frameworks as challenges, stressing that differing national laws on jurisdiction, applicable law, and recognition of protection measures hinder free movement and adequate safeguards for adults with impairments or disabilities. The resolution urged all Member States to ratify the Hague Convention by the end of 2017 and called for a proposed EU regulation by 31 March 2018 to ensure automatic recognition and enforcement of protection measures—such as guardianship or mandates in anticipation of incapacity—across borders, while allowing limited public order exceptions. It advocated for standardized EU forms to streamline information sharing, national registers to track protection measures and mandates, and mechanisms for cross-border cooperation, including central authorities to facilitate communication. The resolution emphasized self-determination for vulnerable adults, non-discrimination, and tailored protections that respect individual capacities, urging Member States to adopt laws enabling advance directives and to eliminate financial barriers to accessing legal safeguards. It also stressed the need for public awareness campaigns on national laws and EU-wide coordination to share costs and responsibilities for protection measures, ensuring compliance with fundamental rights, data privacy, and subsidiarity principles.",

It highlighted that non-profits employ 9 million people in associations and foundations (out of 13.6 million in the broader social economy) and contribute to EU strategic goals, including climate action and digital transformation. The resolution called for a **Regulation establishing a European Association Statute** under Article 352 TFEU to enable cross-border activities, governance transparency, and legal certainty, alongside a **Directive under Article 114 TFEU** setting common minimum standards for non-profits to ensure freedom of association, public benefit recognition, and tax exemptions across member states. It urged the Commission to create a **European Associations Board** for coordination, simplify funding access (noting disparities in pandemic relief), and improve data collection via Eurostat. The Parliament emphasized the need to eliminate discriminatory practices, safeguard independence, and promote mutual recognition of public benefit status, while excluding trade unions and political parties from the scope. It also stressed the importance of addressing barriers like cross-border hiring, banking access, and SLAPPs (strategic lawsuits against public participation) threatening civic space.",
