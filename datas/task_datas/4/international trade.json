The agreement, which eliminates Singapore’s remaining tariffs on EU goods and removes trade barriers like double safety tests for cars and electronics, is projected to boost bilateral trade volumes by 10% over five years, with Singapore’s GDP potentially increasing by 0.94% (€2.7 billion) and the EU’s by €550 million annually. It grants EU firms enhanced access to Singapore’s services sector (financial, telecom, engineering) and public procurement markets, protects 190 EU geographical indications (GIs), and ensures zero duties on agri-food exports (€2.2 billion in 2016). The resolution highlights commitments to sustainability, including alignment with the Paris Agreement, labor rights (urging Singapore to ratify core ILO conventions), and civil society involvement through advisory groups. It notes Singapore’s role as a regional hub (hosting 10,000 EU firms, 50,000 EU exporters, 83% SMEs) and addresses competitive parity with other major economies (US, China, Japan) that already have FTAs with Singapore. The agreement safeguards EU regulatory autonomy, upholds public services, and includes a prudential carve-out for financial stability, while calling for stronger enforcement of environmental and labor provisions through a review clause.",

Key objections included the Investment Court System (ICS), which prioritizes foreign investor rights over public interest by allowing claims without exhausting domestic legal remedies, and the Regulatory Cooperation chapter, which subordinates legislation to economic necessity, risking deregulation. Environmental safeguards were deemed inadequate, citing Canada’s history of challenging EU laws (e.g., REACH, pesticides) and CETA’s failure to enshrine the Precautionary Principle, instead aligning with weaker standards like the Codex Alimentarius. The agreement’s promotion of GMO harmonization and fossil fuel imports from Canadian tar sands (undermining the EU’s Fuel Quality Directive) further threatened climate goals. Public services faced risks due to a Negative List approach with standstill and ratchet clauses, constraining future policy flexibility. Social impacts included projected long-term unemployment and inequality, as 2011 assessments indicated redistribution favoring capital owners, while labor provisions lacked enforceable ILO core standards. Agricultural liberalization risked small-scale farmers and animal welfare, with no binding animal welfare rules. Industrial policy concerns centered on prohibitions against local content requirements, hindering green transitions, and inadequate SME support, noting 1% of exporters (large firms) dominate over half of export value. Procurement rules were criticized for cementing restrictive frameworks, limiting green infrastructure investments. Legal uncertainties persisted, including compatibility with EU Treaties, unresolved CJEU opinions (e.g., pending Belgian request), and contradictory declarations, undermining democratic oversight.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the significant economic benefits of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA), noting that it transformed the EU’s pre-FTA trade deficit of €7.6 billion into a surplus of €2.5 billion by its fifth year, with EU exports to Korea growing by 47% to €44.9 billion and imports from Korea rising by 11% to €42.3 billion. Key sectors like automotive trade saw EU vehicle exports surge by 246% (€6.9 billion) and imports increase by 71% (€4.5 billion), while services trade reached a €6 billion surplus. The agreement eliminated nearly all tariffs, expanded market access in services, investment, and public procurement, and established committees to address non-tariff barriers, though issues persisted, including technical barriers (e.g., restrictive transport clauses, vehicle homologation disputes), sanitary barriers on EU agricultural exports, and insufficient protection of labor rights. Parliament criticized Korea’s failure to ratify core ILO conventions, citing violations of union freedoms and imprisonment of labor leaders, and urged formal consultations under Article 13.14 of the FTA. It highlighted uneven preference utilization rates (68.5% for EU vs. 85% for Korea), stressing potential gains of €900 million for EU exporters through improved compliance. SMEs’ low awareness of FTA benefits was flagged, alongside calls to replace ISDS with a new Investment Court System. Parliament emphasized the FTA’s strategic role in EU-Asia relations and urged stronger enforcement of sustainable development commitments, including labor and environmental standards, while advocating for multilateral cooperation on trade in services and environmental goods.",

        "stance": "EPP rejects the issue's push for TRIPS flexibilities, completely opposeing with the party's stance that intellectual property rights are indispensable for funding pharmaceutical innovation and future pandemic preparedness.  \nEPP opposes the fisheries subsidies prohibition framework as drafted, demanding explicit protections for EU fleets' diesel tax exemptions and operations in contested waters like the Falklands/Malvinas area.  \nThe proposal overlooks critical aspects of vaccine equity by prioritizing patent waivers over tangible solutions like eliminating medical goods tariffs - a position Jörgen Warborn emphasized as vital for pandemic response.  \nEPP condemns the issue's approach to special fisheries subsidies as incompatible with protecting Europe's regulated, sustainable fleets, echoing Francisco Millán Mon's call to defend sectoral exemptions.  \nThis text's support for temporary IP suspensions directly contradicts EPP's evidence-based position that undoing patent protections would cripple mRNA research investments exceeding €50-100 billion."

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over the crisis facing the WTO, including the non-operational Appellate Body since December 2019, threatening dispute resolution and multilateral trade governance. It stressed the urgency of substantive reforms to modernize the WTO, emphasizing outcomes at the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) in 2021, such as concluding an agreement to prohibit harmful fisheries subsidies contributing to overfishing and overcapacity, particularly targeting illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, given over 39 million people depend on fisheries. The resolution called for a pandemic response package, including tariff elimination on medical goods, transparency on trade measures, and addressing TRIPS flexibilities to enhance vaccine access, alongside establishing a WTO Committee on Trade and Health. It urged progress on agriculture, including transparency, public stockholding solutions, and adapting rules to address trade distortions. The Parliament highlighted the need to restore a two-tier dispute settlement system by MC13, reform special and differential treatment to reflect economic realities, and advance plurilateral agreements on e-commerce, digital trade, and environmental goods, including making the e-transmissions moratorium permanent. Climate action integration through trade policy alignment with the Paris Agreement and SDGs was emphasized, alongside gender equality via the 2017 Buenos Aires Declaration on Women and Trade. The resolution also supported MSMEs, labor rights, forced labor prohibitions, and transparency improvements, while urging expanded WTO membership and ratification of customs agreements to reduce bureaucracy.",
