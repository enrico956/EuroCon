The resolution highlighted that IUU fishing depletes global fish stocks (noting 26 million tonnes caught illegally annually, 15% of global catches), threatens marine ecosystems, undermines coastal communities' livelihoods, and exacerbates poverty in developing countries like the Comoros, where EU financial support (€600,000 annually, half earmarked for sustainable fisheries) failed to yield tangible improvements in monitoring, scientific capacity, or technical training over 30 years of cooperation. Parliament stressed the need for the Comoros to fulfill obligations under international law and the 2030 Agenda’s Sustainable Development Goal 14 (marine conservation), urging continued EU support through development funds to strengthen governance, surveillance, and local fisheries while maintaining pressure via trade restrictions until reforms are implemented. It called for future reengagement if the Comoros addresses IUU deficiencies, emphasizing multilateral cooperation, equitable resource sharing, and alignment of EU policies with global sustainability efforts to protect marine biodiversity and artisanal fishers.",

It stressed the need to maintain fish stocks above levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2020, aligning with FAO guidelines, and highlighted the EU’s responsibility to ensure equitable access for developing coastal states to adjacent fisheries resources through regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs). The resolution called for enhanced transparency in Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs), including public disclosure of access terms and catches, and urged harmonizing conditions for foreign fleets in African waters to promote fair competition. It underscored the EU’s role in combating illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing through rigorous enforcement of the IUU Regulation and advocated for improved scientific data collection, particularly in developing countries, to assess surplus stocks. The Parliament emphasized support for small-scale fisheries, gender equality in the sector, and sectoral aid to partner countries for infrastructure, scientific capacity, and food security, while ensuring policy coherence with development goals. It criticized private agreements between EU shipowners and third countries that bypass CFP standards, urging regulatory frameworks for joint ventures to prevent unfair competition with local artisanal fleets. The resolution also highlighted the EU’s market influence, noting it consumes 11% of global fish production by volume and imports 24% by value, and called for trade agreements to enforce sustainability and labor standards. Finally, it advocated for regional management of shared stocks, expanded marine protected areas, and increased funding for RFMOs to strengthen global fisheries governance.",

It builds on a previous protocol (2013-2018), which achieved a 79% average uptake of fishing opportunities but saw underuse by longliners, and emphasizes alignment with Côte d’Ivoire’s Strategic Plan for Fisheries (PSDEPA) and Blue Growth Action Plan, requiring over €140 million for sectoral development.

        "stance": "GREEN_EFA completely sanctions the issue’s alignment with ICCAT scientific advice, ensuring fishing mortality targets adhere to maximum sustainable yield principles critical for species recovery.  \nGREEN_EFA perfectly aligns with the strict monitoring and control measures, recognizing their necessity to prevent a resurgence of industrial overexploitation as historically witnessed.  \nGREEN_EFA proposes strengthening quota allocation mechanisms to prioritize artisanal fisheries, addressing systemic inequities where industrial fleets retain disproportionate access despite past ecological harm.  \nGREEN_EFA applauds the inclusion of by-catch quota provisions for non-target fisheries as a foundational step toward equitable resource sharing in mixed-fishery ecosystems.  \nGREEN_EFA emphasizes that annual caging reports must include granular data on quota beneficiaries to expose and rectify disparities between small-scale and industrial fishing sectors."

        "stance": "ID strongly advocates the inclusion of adverse weather extensions in fishing season provisions, aligning perfectly with ID's longstanding commitment to safeguarding fishermen’s livelihoods amid climate unpredictability.  \nID strongly endorses quota reallocations prioritizing small-scale fisheries, effectively advancing ID's priority of economic equity for coastal communities reliant on artisanal fishing.  \nID strongly approves derogations for small vessels, ensuring flexibility that reflects Mediterranean fishing realities while maintaining sustainability goals.  \nID proposes amending Article 4 to mandate binding timelines for quota redistribution to small-scale fleets in states with sub-20% allocations, enhancing social fairness without opposing the issue’s framework.  \nID strongly advocates transparency in caging reports and quota carryovers, recognizing their critical role in preventing resource monopolization by industrial fleets."

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the need to align EU regulations with updated International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) recommendations, particularly 18-02 and 19-04, to ensure sustainable bluefin tuna management. Key amendments included transitioning from a rebuilding plan to a long-term management plan for bluefin tuna while maintaining strict monitoring and control measures, addressing by-catch quotas for fishers targeting species like swordfish who lack dedicated bluefin tuna allocations, and allowing Member States to carry over up to 10% of unused annual bluefin tuna quotas to subsequent years. The resolution emphasized harmonizing definitions (e.g., \"sport fishery,\" \"fishing effort\") with ICCAT standards to ensure clarity and enforceability, incorporating derogations for joint fishing operations under specific protocols, and requiring annual caging reports from Member States to improve transparency. It stressed that adjustments to fishing mortality targets must follow the ordinary legislative procedure to uphold the Common Fisheries Policy’s maximum sustainable yield (MSY) objectives, while ensuring coherence with ICCAT’s scientific advice and addressing operational challenges in mixed fisheries.",
