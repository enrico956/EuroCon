It stressed the inadequacy of existing mitigation pledges, noting a significant gap between pledged emissions reductions and the 2°C pathway, requiring global emissions to peak by 2015, decline by 50% below 1990 levels by 2050, and reach net-zero emissions thereafter. The resolution called for a legally binding 2015 agreement under the Durban Platform, applicable to all countries and replacing the Kyoto Protocol’s bifurcated framework, with effort-sharing based on equity, common but differentiated responsibilities, and evolving capabilities, using indicators like GDP per capita and technological access. It urged the EU to adopt a 50% domestic greenhouse gas reduction target by 2030, phase out fossil fuel subsidies by 2020, and advocate for global measures such as a carbon market, HFC phase-down (potentially avoiding 2.2 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions by 2020), and inclusion of international aviation and maritime emissions in mitigation frameworks. The Parliament highlighted the need for developed nations to fulfill climate finance commitments, including $100 billion annually by 2020, with additional funding for the Green Climate Fund and Adaptation Fund, while ensuring climate financing is separate from official development assistance. It emphasized adaptation and loss-and-damage mechanisms for vulnerable nations, sustainable agriculture, REDD+ initiatives to combat deforestation, and the role of decentralized renewable energy in reducing emissions. The resolution also underscored the economic benefits of climate action, including job creation and energy security, and called for enhanced EU leadership through ambitious 2030 targets, innovation in clean technologies, and diplomatic efforts to unify global negotiations ahead of COP 21 in Paris.",

It emphasized the urgent need for a holistic \"One Health\" approach to address AMR through coordinated human and veterinary measures, stressing that misuse of antimicrobials in both sectors accelerates resistance. Key recommendations included strict limits on prophylactic and non-essential antimicrobial use in animals, banning growth promoters in livestock, enhancing surveillance of antimicrobial consumption and resistance patterns via harmonized EU-wide databases, and accelerating research into new antibiotics and alternatives like vaccines. The resolution called for revising veterinary legislation to restrict critically important antimicrobials (CIAs) for humans in animals, improving diagnostics to enable targeted treatments, and enforcing prescription-only access to curb overuse. It urged Member States to adopt electronic monitoring of farm antibiotic use, promote sustainable livestock practices to reduce disease risks, and launch public awareness campaigns on prudent antimicrobial use. The Parliament also highlighted the need for international collaboration, aligning with WHO and OIE guidelines, and strengthening EU-US cooperation through initiatives like the Transatlantic Taskforce on Antimicrobial Resistance. Additionally, it demanded rapid implementation of the EU’s AMR Action Plan, including progress reports by 2013, and stressed the importance of reducing reliance on CIAs while ensuring equitable access to effective antimicrobials for both human and animal health.",

It adjusted free allowance allocation by linking it to trade and emissions intensity, introduced a 0.3% benchmark reduction rate for certain industries, and allowed up to 2% of auctioned allowances to mitigate carbon leakage risks. Small emitters’ thresholds were raised to 50,000 tCO2e, with ultra-small emitters (<5,000 tCO2e) exempted. The Innovation Fund was bolstered with 150 million unallocated allowances, 50% funded via auctions, supporting up to 75% of project costs, with 60% of funding independent of verified emissions reductions. Projects over €20 million were prioritized, and cogeneration became eligible for support. Member States must establish national rules for small projects via public consultation, while an Investment Board (comprising Member States, the EIB, and the Commission) oversees selection criteria, also subject to consultation. Production-linked allocation adjustments (10% change trigger) and biennial allowance surrenders for retired electricity capacity were introduced.",

The Parliament emphasized that the General Court’s 2015 judgment requires criteria to be based solely on objective scientific data, independent of economic considerations, and stressed that altering essential regulatory elements like the cut-off criterion must be done via legislative amendment under Article 294 TFEU, not through implementing acts. It criticized the draft for failing to align with the Seventh Environment Action Programme’s mandate for horizontal, hazard-based criteria, noting omissions such as a “suspected endocrine disrupter” category (akin to CMR classifications in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008) and the exclusion of read-across methodologies, which could hinder regulatory action and necessitate redundant animal testing. The Parliament also highlighted inconsistencies between the draft regulation’s simplified definition of “endocrine mode of action” and the stricter EFSA/ECHA guidance, which risks underidentifying disruptors, and opposed the prioritization of data from standardized protocols over independent studies. It called for the draft’s withdrawal, deletion of the exemption clause, and revised guidance ensuring scientific rigor, weight-of-evidence approaches, and parity in data evaluation.",

It cited public support, with 89% of EU citizens advocating stronger international animal welfare measures, and noted 80% of countries still permit cosmetic animal testing. The Parliament urged increased funding for alternative testing methods, particularly for complex toxicological endpoints, and emphasized international collaboration (e.g., via the EPAA, ICCR, and ICATM) to accelerate validation and knowledge transfer. It demanded strict enforcement of EU bans, including audits for compliance, exclusion of animal-tested cosmetics from trade deals, and safeguards against WTO rule conflicts. Academic institutions and regulators were urged to prioritize training on alternatives, while the CJEU’s 2016 ruling was referenced to reinforce bans on products tested abroad.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over air pollution’s severe health and environmental impacts in Europe, citing over 400,000 annual premature deaths linked primarily to particulate matter (PM₂.₅, responsible for 379,000 deaths in 2018), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂, 54,000 deaths), and ozone (O₃, 19,400 deaths). It highlighted disproportionate harm to vulnerable groups and ecosystems, with 65% of Europe’s ecosystem area exceeding eutrophication limits due to NOx and ammonia, and 6% facing acidification from NOx and SO₂. The resolution criticized outdated EU air quality standards, which lag behind WHO guidelines—exposing 77% of urban populations to PM₂.₅ levels above WHO recommendations versus 8% under weaker EU limits. It urged alignment with WHO standards via the European Green Deal and emphasized strengthening monitoring networks (4,000 stations, 16,000 sampling points) by revising placement rules to reflect high-exposure areas. Lessons from COVID-19 lockdowns, which reduced transport-related emissions, were noted as a basis for integrating air quality into recovery plans. The Parliament called for stringent measures targeting major pollution sources—transport, energy, industry, and agriculture—and criticized ineffective Air Quality Plans (32 infringement cases against 20 Member States), demanding stricter enforcement, annual reporting, and EU-wide best practices. It stressed mainstreaming air quality across climate, energy, and agricultural policies and improving public awareness through standardized air quality indices and campaigns on health risks.",
