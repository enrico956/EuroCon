It highlighted annual costs between €156 million and €204 million (10% of its budget) and CO₂ emissions of 11,000–19,000 tonnes due to monthly relocations, with Strasbourg’s buildings unused 89% of the year. Emphasizing its evolution into a co-legislator with increased legislative activity (454 ordinary procedures in 2004–2009 versus 165 in 1993–1999), Parliament argued that its dispersion isolates it from other EU institutions and stakeholders, undermining efficiency and transparency. It noted strong public opposition, including a petition signed by over one million citizens, and a 2012 plenary vote where 78% of MEPs supported revising the seat arrangement. Parliament called for a Treaty revision under Article 48 TEU to amend Article 341 TFEU and Protocol 6, enabling it to determine its own seat and working arrangements. It requested independent analyses of potential savings from a single seat (Brussels) and a Eurobarometer survey by 2014 on citizens’ views, while acknowledging the need for orderly transition and continued use of existing buildings.

It called for a common EU legal statute to grant parties direct legal personality, streamline funding procedures, and reduce bureaucratic hurdles, proposing full upfront annual funding (100% instead of 80%) and lowering self-financing requirements to 10% of total budgets for parties (abolishing it for foundations). The Parliament urged raising donation limits to €25,000 per donor annually (with transparency safeguards), allowing parties to engage in EU-related referendum campaigns, and encouraging direct individual membership. It stressed the need for sanctions for funding violations and requested the Commission to propose a tailored Financial Regulation title for party funding, alongside transnational electoral reforms. The resolution also emphasized aligning party operations across regional, national, and EU levels to strengthen democratic accountability and responsiveness.",

The resolution emphasized education and vocational training reforms, particularly dual systems combining academic and practical skills, as critical to improving employability in growing sectors like ICT, green jobs, and healthcare. It endorsed the Youth Guarantee, urging swift implementation to ensure under-25s and recent graduates under 30 receive employment, education, or apprenticeship offers within four months of unemployment or leaving education, while stressing the need for quality frameworks to safeguard working conditions and wages. Financial measures included allocating €6 billion for the Youth Employment Initiative, advocating frontloading funds, and revising the Multiannual Financial Framework to meet the International Labour Organisation’s €21 billion estimate for eurozone implementation. It called for leveraging the European Social Fund (at least 25% of cohesion policy funds), €60 billion from the European Investment Bank, and €16 billion in reallocated structural funds to support youth employment and SMEs. The resolution urged Member States to combat school dropouts (15% leaving without secondary qualifications), promote partnerships between education and businesses, and enhance mobility while addressing brain drain risks. It criticized austerity cuts to education and youth programs, advocating social investment in job creation, apprenticeships, and self-employment support, and called for crisis measures harming youth employment to be reassessed. Finally, it stressed the need for EU-wide social indicators, private sector collaboration, and aligning curricula with labor market demands to ensure sustainable growth and social rights.",

Despite over four years of informal negotiations, working documents, and legal consultations between the institutions’ services, the Council and Commission refused to engage in formal political discussions to resolve key disagreements, including institutional resistance to granting Parliament robust inquiry tools such as witness summons and document access. The resolution criticized this as a breach of sincere interinstitutional cooperation (Article 13(2) TEU) and democratic accountability, emphasizing Parliament’s constitutional role in overseeing the executive. It highlighted lessons from recent inquiry committees (PANA on financial crimes and EMIS on emissions fraud), which underscored the need for updated investigative rules. Parliament urged its President to escalate the issue to EU leaders, proposed legal action via the Court of Justice to enforce cooperation obligations, and called on political parties and *Spitzenkandidaten* to publicly support the revised regulation. The resolution also stressed that the current procedural framework under Article 226 TFEU does not oblige the Council and Commission to negotiate, but Parliament insisted they resume talks based on a revised proposal reflecting legal consultations and practical experience, while invoking the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making to demand structured negotiations. The text was forwarded to EU institutions and national parliaments to reinforce accountability demands.",

It urged OLAF to justify non-implementation of SC recommendations, improve transparency in its participation in Commission ‘Clearing House’ meetings, and comply with legal requirements on investigation timelines. The Parliament called on the Commission to strengthen the SC’s mandate by amending Working Arrangements by 31 December 2015, ensuring the SC’s Secretariat operates independently, with full access to case files and authority over staffing and budget.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the need to modernize the role and operational framework of the European Ombudsman by adopting a new regulation to replace the outdated 1994 Decision, aligning it with post-Lisbon Treaty legal standards. The regulation strengthens the Ombudsman’s mandate to investigate maladministration in EU institutions, bodies, and agencies (excluding the Court of Justice in its judicial role), emphasizing the right to good administration under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. It grants the Ombudsman authority to conduct own-initiative inquiries to address systemic issues, follow up on compliance with recommendations, and submit annual reports to Parliament assessing institutional compliance and resource adequacy. Complaints must be filed within three years of the complainant becoming aware of the issue, after exhausting administrative remedies, and can remain confidential. The Ombudsman has broad access to information, including classified documents, subject to confidentiality agreements, and must notify relevant authorities (e.g., the European Public Prosecutor’s Office) of potential criminal matters while respecting due process rights. Institutions are required to respond to inquiries within three months (extendable by two months) and cooperate fully, with non-compliance reported to Parliament. The Ombudsman’s independence is safeguarded through appointment by Parliament for the parliamentary term, with qualifications mirroring judicial standards, and a budget ensuring operational autonomy. The regulation also mandates cooperation with national ombudsmen and EU bodies like the Fundamental Rights Agency, while ensuring staff confidentiality and procedural safeguards for handling sensitive data.",

The resolution noted challenges, including lengthy procedures due to unclear timelines, lack of operational guidelines, and reliance on intergovernmental agreements outside EU frameworks (e.g., the Fiscal Compact), which undermine legal consistency and democratic scrutiny.

The agreement introduces a roadmap for new own resources, including potential levies linked to sustainability and digitalization, to cover repayment costs of the €750 billion NGEU debt while ensuring sufficient revenue ceilings and adherence to budgetary discipline under Article 310 TFEU. It mandates monitoring of climate and biodiversity spending, with 30% of the EU budget and NGEU expenditures allocated to climate objectives, a biodiversity spending target of 7.5% by 2024 rising to 10% in 2026-2027, and gender equality and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) tracking. Enhanced budgetary scrutiny of NGEU funds includes institutional cooperation on governance, transparency in project selection for the Recovery and Resilience Facility, and involvement of regional authorities to ensure equitable recovery. The IIA strengthens data standardization for tracking beneficiaries, improves transparency in budgetary programming, and safeguards special instruments like the Brexit Adjustment Reserve and Flexibility Instrument. It replaces the 2013 Interinstitutional Agreement, operationalizes treaty-based cooperation during MFF negotiations, and integrates rule-of-law conditionality for budget protection, reflecting commitments to the Paris Agreement and COVID-19 recovery priorities.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the critical need for enhanced transparency, democratic accountability, and parliamentary scrutiny in implementing the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), emphasizing the Commission’s obligation to regularly inform Parliament on the status of national recovery and resilience plans, including reforms and investments aligned with the RRF’s six pillars and 11 assessment criteria. It highlighted that 18 Member States had submitted their plans by the resolution’s adoption, with the Commission required to assess each within two months, and urged timely approval of delegated acts on the recovery scoreboard and social expenditure methodology before the summer recess. Parliament stressed the importance of accessible, comparable information formats, translations of national documents, and preliminary findings on milestones and targets prior to their formal assessment. It called for robust stakeholder consultations at national levels, particularly involving local authorities, civil society, and social partners, as mandated by Article 18(4)(q) of the RRF Regulation, and insisted on full transparency in the Commission’s dialogue with Parliament to uphold democratic legitimacy and citizen ownership of the RRF. The resolution also reminded the Council to share relevant preparatory discussions with Parliament and urged the Commission to maintain an open, constructive approach throughout the recovery and resilience dialogue.",
