It emphasized structural challenges, including a 16% gender pay gap, a 37.2% gender pension gap, and unmet Barcelona childcare targets (90% coverage for children aged 3+). The resolution urged measures to address in-work poverty, precarious employment, and inadequate social protection for atypical workers, calling for a European unemployment benefit reinsurance scheme, fair minimum wage legislation, and a European Child Guarantee. It stressed the need for reskilling 25% of the workforce in high-emission sectors to support the green transition, alongside digital literacy and mental health initiatives (costing over €600 billion annually). The Parliament criticized slow implementation of 2019 Country-Specific Recommendations (only 9% fully achieved) and advocated for stronger social dialogue, affordable housing, accessible healthcare, and alignment of EU funds with social and climate goals. It highlighted the urgency of reducing inequalities, improving collective bargaining, and ensuring inclusive growth through the European Pillar of Social Rights and Sustainable Development Goals.",

It highlighted systemic vulnerabilities, including precarious working conditions, inadequate social security coverage, unsafe housing, and barriers to healthcare, exacerbated by border closures and travel restrictions. The resolution urged Member States and the Commission to ensure equal treatment under EU law, enforce health and safety standards—including access to testing, PPE, and decent accommodation—and lift discriminatory travel measures. It called for robust implementation of directives on seasonal workers (2014/36/EU), temporary agency work (2008/104/EC), and posted workers (2018/957/EU), alongside accelerating the European Labour Authority’s operational capacity to address labor rights violations and improve cross-border data collection. The Parliament stressed the need for digital solutions, such as a potential European Social Security Number, to streamline social security coordination and combat undeclared work, while advocating for updated pandemic-proof legislation, fair access to social benefits, and strengthened whistle-blower protections under Directive 2019/1937. Additionally, it emphasized the urgency of equitable access to healthcare, transparent labor contracts, and cooperation with social partners to safeguard workers’ rights and ensure economic recovery.",

It highlighted that intra-EU labor mobility involved 17.9 million people in 2019, with 13 million of working age, and noted challenges such as undeclared work (11.6% of EU private sector labor input) and vulnerabilities exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which exacerbated precarious conditions for cross-border and seasonal workers. The resolution emphasized the limitations of existing tools like the A1 portable document (4.6 million issued in 2019), which lacks real-time data, and called for the ESSP to enable real-time verification of employment status, social security contributions, and compliance with EU labor laws, while integrating with the European e-ID, EESSI (Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information), and EHIC (European Health Insurance Card). Parliament urged the Commission to propose a legislative framework for the ESSP by 2022, ensuring mandatory adoption across Member States, strict data protection, and interoperability with national systems, including labor inspection tools. It stressed the ESSP’s role in preventing social dumping, improving enforcement of equal pay and working conditions, and facilitating portability of pension and social rights, particularly for sectors like transport and construction. The resolution also underscored the need to address gaps in monitoring posted workers, streamline cross-border administrative procedures, and leverage digitalization to reduce fraud and administrative burdens, especially for SMEs. Additionally, it highlighted the ESSP’s potential to support the European Labour Authority (ELA) in joint inspections and align with the European Pillar of Social Rights, ensuring no worker is disadvantaged by mobility.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the inadequacy of the EU list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions in effectively combating global tax avoidance, which costs an estimated USD 500 billion annually and deprives the EU of 20% of its corporate tax revenue due to profit shifting. While acknowledging the list’s positive impact—such as prompting over 135 countries to engage in tax reforms and leading to revisions of 120 harmful tax practices—it criticized the list’s limited scope, noting jurisdictions on it account for less than 2% of global tax losses, with the Cayman Islands alone responsible for USD 70 billion annually despite being removed in 2020. The resolution called for stricter, transparent, and impartial criteria, including standalone assessments for jurisdictions with 0% corporate tax rates, enhanced substance requirements, and alignment with OECD/G20 BEPS standards, particularly Pillar II on minimum taxation. It urged reforms to the listing process, advocating a legally binding framework, greater parliamentary oversight, and public disclosure of assessments, commitments, and correspondence with third countries. The Parliament emphasized the need to hold EU Member States to the same standards, citing instances of aggressive tax planning within the EU, and demanded coordinated defensive measures—such as non-deductibility of costs, withholding taxes, and procurement restrictions—against non-compliant jurisdictions. It also highlighted the importance of fairness in assessing developing countries and major trading partners like the US and post-Brexit UK, while warning against detrimental impacts of aid cuts on vulnerable populations. Overall, the resolution stressed the urgency of strengthening the list’s credibility, transparency, and enforcement to align with global tax justice goals and public demand for robust anti-avoidance measures.",
