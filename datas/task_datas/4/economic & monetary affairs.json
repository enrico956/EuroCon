It noted the ECB’s monetary policy actions, including two interest rate hikes (25 basis points each in April and August 2011) followed by two reductions (25 basis points each in November and December 2011), and the launch of three-year Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) totaling over €1 trillion (€489.2 billion in December 2011 and €529.5 billion in February 2012) to stabilize financial markets. Despite these efforts, credit growth to the private sector slowed sharply (from 1.6% in 2010 to 0.4% in 2011), inflation rose to 2.7% (driven by energy prices), and government debt increased to 88% of GDP. The resolution acknowledged the ECB’s Securities Markets Programme (SMP), which temporarily reduced borrowing costs for struggling states, but criticized structural shortcomings, including risks from transferring sovereign and bank liabilities to the ECB’s balance sheet (now over 30% of eurozone GDP) and excessive reliance on non-marketable collateral (23% of total). It urged greater transparency, including publication of collateral details, voting records, and SMP bond purchase prices, and called for conditional lending to boost SME credit, which employs 72% of the workforce. The Parliament stressed the urgency of a banking union with a single supervisory mechanism (SSM), resolution authority, and deposit guarantees, while safeguarding against conflicts between monetary and supervisory roles. It criticized the ECB’s lack of gender parity in leadership and insufficient accountability of the Troika, demanding enhanced parliamentary oversight.

It urged the Commission to propose legislation by January 2013 if a 2012 assessment confirmed inadequate progress, stressing harmonized standards, simplified customer due diligence, and safeguards against over-indebtedness. The directive should require Member States to enforce provider compliance, monitor refusals, and establish dispute mechanisms, while promoting financial education and cross-border account portability. It highlighted successful legislative models in Finland and Denmark, where near-universal coverage was achieved, and noted that 67% of account penetration disparities stem from regulatory, not economic, factors. The resolution also emphasized integrating prepaid and mobile banking solutions and ensuring non-discriminatory access to payment channels.",

The resolution called for stricter enforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), introducing an Excessive Debt Surveillance Procedure (EDSP) to monitor debt sustainability, contingent liabilities (e.g., pensions), and fiscal consolidation timelines, aiming to realign deficits with SGP rules by 2015. It advocated for a \"European Semester\" to synchronize national budgetary and reform plans (SCPs and NRPs) with EU oversight, enhanced transparency, and involvement of national parliaments. To address crises, it proposed a permanent European stabilisation mechanism (e.g., a European Monetary Fund) based on existing tools, alongside feasibility studies for common EU bonds. Other measures included tax policy coordination to combat fraud, reinforced Eurostat powers to audit national statistics, and harmonized budget reporting. The resolution urged institutional reforms, such as consolidating Commission roles, improving Euro Group accountability, and exploring Treaty changes for deeper integration, while safeguarding ECB independence and balancing fiscal discipline with investments in cohesion, innovation, and social protections.",

The Parliament stressed the urgency of adopting the 2011 MiFID review to regulate financial instruments and derivatives, the 2012 Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) to improve securities settlement, and the long-delayed Securities Law Directive, pending since 2010, to ensure legal certainty in cross-border transactions. It criticized the Commission for not revising the Payment Services Directive by the 2012 deadline and for delaying proposals on money market funds, despite ESRB recommendations to address liquidity risks. The resolution urged swift adoption of the 2012 bank recovery and resolution framework to limit taxpayer exposure, called for revising the 2002 Financial Conglomerates Directive post-CRD IV and SSM implementation, and demanded accelerated work on the Single Resolution Mechanism and bank structural reforms (Liikanen proposals). Emphasizing interdependencies between reforms, the Parliament linked timely adoption of these measures to financial stability, consumer protection, and sustainable growth, citing the Cypriot crisis as a stark reminder of the need for credible DGS. It also pressed for a comprehensive impact assessment of post-crisis financial legislation and urged the Council to prioritize negotiations using qualified-majority voting to avoid further delays ahead of the 2014 legislative term expiry.",

The Parliament stressed improving OECD standards to mandate automatic multilateral information exchange globally, revising accounting rules for country-by-country tax disclosures, and creating an EU public register for entities in tax havens. It advocated a common EU corporate tax base to address transfer pricing, urged sanctions like levies on non-cooperative jurisdictions, and emphasized support for developing countries in building transparent tax systems.

It acknowledged the SSM’s operational success since 2014 in enhancing supervisory quality and financial stability but called for reduced administrative burdens, improved proportionality in reporting (notably for smaller banks via AnaCredit thresholds), and better integration of macro-prudential policies, including liquidity stress testing and systemic risk monitoring. The resolution highlighted challenges such as non-performing loans (urging asset management solutions), insufficient credit growth, and the need to harmonize supervisory practices by closing 35 national regulatory discrepancies. It stressed the SRM’s role in resolving failing banks, advocating swift adoption of a minimum 8% MREL requirement, bridge financing for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), and stronger cooperation between the SRB and ECB. On deposit guarantees, Parliament welcomed the proposed European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) but emphasized preconditioning it on risk reduction and BRRD implementation. Key numerical references included Greek banks’ recapitalization needs (€4.4–14.4 billion under stress tests) and the ECB’s comprehensive assessment of 2013–2014. The resolution also urged addressing sovereign exposure risks, enhancing transparency in supervisory decisions (e.g., SREP outcomes), and ensuring accountability through improved audit mechanisms and ECB engagement with Parliament. It called for global regulatory consistency, vigilance over shadow banking, and safeguarding diverse banking models while avoiding regulatory arbitrage.",

It supported digitalization via eIDAS Regulation for cross-border e-identification but stressed the need to maintain high street banks for vulnerable groups.

Unemployment remained alarmingly high at 11.9% in 2013, with youth unemployment exceeding 50% in some states, exacerbating economic divergence.

The resolution stressed the need for structural reforms, growth-friendly fiscal policies, and public investment—such as the proposed €300 billion Juncker plan—to complement ECB actions, warning that prolonged low rates risked distorting markets and undermining savings.

It urged the ECB to enhance transparency, avoid discrimination in APP implementation, and carefully manage exit strategies from unconventional tools. The Parliament welcomed initiatives like the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and the Capital Markets Union (CMU) but stressed that monetary policy alone cannot resolve structural issues, requiring fiscal consolidation and reforms.

The resolution called for integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into financial regulations, including mandatory disclosure frameworks, fiduciary duties, and prudential rules to reflect climate risks. It urged the establishment of an EU sustainability taxonomy by 2019 to standardize ESG metrics, a \"Green Finance Mark\" for high-standard sustainable products, and amendments to directives (e.g., Non-Financial Reporting, Shareholder Rights) to enforce ESG transparency. The Parliament stressed the role of public institutions like the EIB and ECB in prioritizing Paris Agreement-aligned investments, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, and issuing green bonds, while advocating for \"carbon stress tests\" to assess financial stability risks. It also emphasized closing the EUR 1.5 trillion social infrastructure gap, promoting green FinTech for SMEs, and ensuring EU spending coherence with climate goals, including 20% of the budget for climate action. International alignment with UN SDGs, OECD guidelines, and G20 commitments was underscored, alongside reforms to credit rating methodologies and stewardship requirements to foster long-term, sustainable capital allocation.",

Concerns over foreign subsidies distorting the single market led to calls for robust implementation of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation and enhanced global cooperation, including through the EU-US Trade and Technology Council.

It urged modernization of merger control rules to address data concentration, zero-price markets, and \"killer acquisitions,\" emphasizing personal data’s role in digital mergers. Antitrust reforms were advocated to tackle vertical agreements, geo-blocking, and territorial supply constraints, alongside stronger enforcement against anti-competitive practices in agriculture, IoT, and digital advertising.

It highlighted the EIB’s approval of EUR 23.5 billion for 84 EU COVID-19 operations by September 2020, with 88% targeting SMEs and health sectors, and EUR 5.2 billion for non-EU countries. The resolution stressed the need for continued EGF operations beyond 2021 due to prolonged pandemic impacts. Parliament welcomed the EIB’s Climate Bank Roadmap 2021-2025, aiming to increase climate-related financing to 50% by 2025, align with the Paris Agreement by 2023, and end fossil fuel investments by 2021, while phasing out airport expansion support by 2022. It called for a capital increase to sustain the EIB’s AAA rating and enhance investments in green and digital transitions, noting the EUR 350 billion annual climate investment gap. The resolution urged stronger support for SMEs (EUR 30.56 billion in 2020, aiding 425,000 firms), innovation (EUR 14.43 billion in 2020), and social infrastructure, including health, education, and housing. It emphasized addressing regional disparities, enhancing transparency, and avoiding conflicts of interest, advocating for stricter anti-fraud measures, gender equality (51.4% female workforce but underrepresentation in leadership), and human rights due diligence. The EIB’s external lending (EUR 10.23 billion in 2020, including EUR 2.3 billion for least developed countries) was urged to align with EU standards, prioritize SDGs, and avoid debt burdens through grants over loans. Parliament also called for improved governance, accountability, and cooperation with EU bodies, stressing the need for harmonized project assessments using the EU taxonomy and DNSH criteria.",

The DAC framework, expanded through DAC1-4, mandates automatic exchange of tax-related information on income categories (employment, pensions, financial accounts, tax rulings, and Country-by-Country Reports for multinationals with €750M+ revenue), but gaps persist in covering capital gains, non-financial assets (e.g., art, yachts), and loopholes in financial reporting.

It urged the Commission to issue guidelines, establish a cost-benefit framework, and publish annual summaries of exchanged data. Weak anti-money laundering (AML) rules in many Member States and FATF’s low effectiveness ratings further undermine DAC’s impact.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the EU’s economic governance framework, emphasizing its complexity, pro-cyclical biases, and failure to reduce divergences or protect public investment, while highlighting the need for reform amid COVID-19 recovery. It noted the activation of the Stability and Growth Pact’s general escape clause until 2023 to enable fiscal flexibility, allowing Member States to adopt expansive measures (with EU aggregate debt-to-GDP exceeding 100%) and avoid premature consolidation. The resolution stressed the necessity of targeted fiscal support to address scarring effects, inequalities, and investment gaps, citing annual funding needs of €470 billion for environmental objectives, €142 billion for social infrastructure, and €190 billion to stabilize public capital. It called for a revised governance framework prioritizing sustainable growth, debt sustainability through country-specific adjustment paths, and simplified rules such as an expenditure-based system with safeguards for green and social investments. The Parliament advocated maintaining expansionary fiscal policies to support recovery, leveraging NextGenerationEU (NGEU) and SURE instruments, while ensuring transparent debt management and repayment plans. It emphasized aligning fiscal policies with the European Green Deal and social rights, integrating climate risks into debt sustainability analyses, and improving the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP) to address structural divergences. The resolution also urged stronger democratic accountability, enhanced role for independent fiscal institutions, and better coordination between EU and national levels to ensure ownership and compliance with reforms.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over significant gaps in the implementation of the EU’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) framework, particularly noting that many Member States failed to properly transpose the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (4AMLD) by its June 2017 deadline, prompting infringement procedures by the Commission. It stressed urgency in meeting the 10 January 2020 deadline for transposing the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), including establishing beneficial ownership registers, and highlighted risks of further delays. The resolution cited the Danske Bank case, involving over €200 billion in suspicious transactions, as emblematic of supervisory failures and criticized the rejection of a breach-of-law recommendation by national supervisors within the European Banking Authority (EBA). It underscored systemic weaknesses, including regulatory fragmentation, insufficient cross-border cooperation among Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs), and the need to consider replacing directives with directly applicable regulations to harmonize AML/CTF rules. The Parliament criticized the Commission’s February 2019 list of 23 high-risk third countries—including Afghanistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia—which the Council rejected due to procedural flaws, and called for a transparent, autonomous methodology to identify such countries, free from diplomatic interference, while proposing a \"grey list\" akin to tax non-cooperative jurisdictions. It urged increased resources for AML enforcement, welcomed the EBA’s strengthened role, and emphasized the economic impact of money laundering, citing Europol estimates that 0.7–1.28% of EU GDP (€110–190 billion annually) is linked to illicit financial flows. The resolution also advocated for a potential EU-level supervisory body and improved coordination mechanisms to address cross-border threats.",
