It highlighted critical gaps, including 264 million children out of school in 2015, 4 million refugee children lacking primary education, and systemic disparities disadvantaging girls in conflict zones. The Parliament called for updated EU strategies to address quality education, teacher training, infrastructure (noting sub-Saharan Africa’s lack of electricity and water in schools), digital literacy, and gender equality, stressing the need for inclusive systems for marginalized groups. It advocated innovative financing, including an International Finance Facility for Education, and integration of humanitarian aid (10% for education in crises). The resolution linked education to health, employability, and conflict prevention, urging partnerships with civil society, private sector engagement in vocational training, and measures to counter \"brain drain.\" It emphasized monitoring aid effectiveness, donor coordination, and accountability, while rejecting ODA support for private education conflicting with EU values.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the imperative of integrating digital technologies into EU development policy to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), emphasizing their role in education, gender equality, infrastructure, and inclusive growth. It highlighted the Digital4Development (D4D) strategy’s alignment with the 2030 Agenda, stressing the need to address digital divides, including disparities in internet access—noting that 1.1 billion people lack official identity documentation (78% in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia) and over half the global population remains offline, jeopardizing SDG 9’s target of universal internet access in least developed countries (LDCs) by 2020. The resolution called for increased funding under the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) to bolster digital infrastructure, e-governance, and cybersecurity in developing countries, while addressing environmental risks like electronic waste (e-waste) and the 2-5% global CO2 emissions from digital technologies. It urged policy coherence to ensure digital trade aligns with sustainable development, including consumer protection, data privacy, and competition policies to counter monopolies by major tech firms. The Parliament emphasized digital literacy and skills training, integration of ICTs into education systems, and support for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), particularly women-led businesses, to enhance economic inclusion. It advocated for ethical humanitarian innovation, risk assessments in digital projects, and partnerships with regional bodies like the African Union to advance connectivity and regulatory frameworks. Environmental sustainability measures included promoting circular economy practices, reducing reliance on conflict minerals like coltan, and supporting agro-ecological farming through digital tools. The resolution also underscored digital technology’s potential in health services, disaster response, birth registration, and combating corruption via e-governance, while cautioning against risks to privacy, labor markets, and democratic processes.",

The resolution emphasized the need for fair, transparent tax systems to fund public services, reduce inequality, and achieve sustainable development, stressing that tax-to-GDP ratios in developing countries (10-20%) lag behind OECD nations (30-40%). Key demands included urgent EU action to support developing countries in combating tax evasion through measures like country-by-country reporting (CBCR) for multinationals, automatic tax information exchange, and revising tax treaties to ensure profits are taxed where economic activity occurs. It called for a 2015 blacklist of tax havens, penalties for their use, and reforms to strengthen developing countries’ tax administrations via technical assistance, anti-corruption initiatives, and capacity-building programs. The EU was urged to prioritize policy coherence, align development aid with tax governance (noting only 0.1% of ODA targeted tax capacity in 2012), and support international efforts like the OECD’s BEPS project and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The resolution also advocated for equitable participation of developing countries in global tax governance and stricter oversight of EU financial institutions to prevent complicity in tax evasion.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over persistent gaps in sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) globally, reaffirming commitments to the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action and the Nairobi Summit’s \"three zeros\" targets: zero unmet need for family planning, zero preventable maternal deaths, and zero gender-based violence and harmful practices. It highlighted that 214 million women in developing countries lack access to modern contraception, leading to 75 million unintended pregnancies annually, while 25 million unsafe abortions occur each year, contributing to maternal mortality. The resolution stressed the need for universal access to SRHR, including safe abortion, comprehensive sexuality education (CSE), and maternal healthcare, particularly for marginalized groups. It condemned restrictive laws, third-party authorization requirements, and ideological barriers impeding access, noting disparities within the EU and globally. The Parliament called for increased funding, including the EU’s commitment of €29 million for adolescent SRHR, and urged allocating 20% of official development assistance (ODA) to gender equality. It emphasized addressing gender-based violence, female genital mutilation (FGM), child marriage (affecting 650 million women), and discrimination against LGBTIQ individuals. The resolution linked SRHR to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), advocating for healthcare integration, youth participation, and accountability mechanisms. It criticized regressive policies in some countries and urged ratification of the Istanbul Convention, while supporting the Spotlight Initiative to combat violence against women and girls. Maternal mortality reductions (44% since 1995) and progress in contraceptive access (64% coverage by 2015) were acknowledged, but urgent action was demanded to eliminate preventable deaths, unsafe abortions, and systemic inequalities in healthcare access.",

It highlighted the COVID-19 pandemic’s exacerbation of hunger, pushing 300 million into acute food insecurity, and stressed the widening funding gap, with only 30% of the $36.6 billion UN appeal met as of August 2021. The resolution urged increased, predictable EU humanitarian funding, advocating for Member States to contribute fixed shares of their gross national incomes, and emphasized the EU’s role as the largest global donor, providing 36% of humanitarian assistance in 2020. It called for enhanced localisation of aid, aligning with the Grand Bargain 2.0 target of 25% direct funding to local actors, and supported private sector engagement through blending initiatives and disaster risk insurance, while ensuring compliance with humanitarian principles. The Parliament condemned violations of international humanitarian law, including attacks on civilians and aid workers, and demanded sanctions for using starvation as a weapon of war. It stressed the need for climate resilience, disaster risk reduction, and triple nexus approaches (humanitarian-development-peace) to address root causes of fragility, alongside gender-sensitive interventions to protect women and girls, who face heightened risks in crises. Key initiatives included the EU Humanitarian Air Bridge, climate adaptation funding via the Global Europe instrument, and the inaugural EU Humanitarian Forum in January 2022 to strengthen strategic dialogue and visibility of EU aid. The resolution also emphasized revising nutrition strategies, ensuring unhindered healthcare access, and integrating education in emergencies to protect vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities and LGBTIQ+ communities.",

It highlighted that the wealthiest 1% of the global population emitted over twice as much CO₂ as the poorest 50% between 1990 and 2015, while the richest 10% accounted for 52% of emissions, exacerbating inequalities. Climate change is projected to displace over 143 million people in Latin America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, with women—comprising 70% of the world’s poorest—disproportionately affected due to gendered roles in agriculture, water collection, and heightened risks of violence and displacement (80% of climate-displaced individuals are women and children). Indigenous peoples, safeguarding 80% of global biodiversity, face heightened vulnerability from land-grabbing and extractive industries, despite their traditional knowledge enhancing resilience. The resolution stressed the need for urgent EU-led climate action, including increased adaptation financing, technology transfers, debt relief for developing countries, and integration of gender-responsive policies. It called for legal protections for climate-displaced persons, noting the absence of international frameworks, and urged alignment of EU development policies with the SDGs, Paris Agreement, and human rights obligations, prioritizing support for small-scale agriculture, fisheries (threatened by 20-40% biomass declines in tropical regions by 2100), and ecosystem-based adaptation. The EU was urged to address structural drivers of vulnerability, such as poverty and inequality, while scaling up climate resilience efforts in least developed countries, small island states, and conflict-affected regions, ensuring equitable partnerships and upholding the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.",
