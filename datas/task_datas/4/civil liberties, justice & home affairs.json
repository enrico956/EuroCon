The resolution called for robust procedural safeguards, including judicial review of OLAF investigations, legal aid for indigent defendants, and data protection standards, alongside balanced geographical and gender representation in EPPO staffing. It criticized the proposed appointment process for the EPPO as undemocratic, demanding greater parliamentary involvement in selecting the chief prosecutor and a transparent dismissal mechanism. Concerns were raised about potential opt-outs by Member States, which could create costly double structures, and the lack of a dedicated EU budget line or updated financial analysis to address resource needs for OLAF’s remaining anti-fraud tasks. The Parliament stressed the need for a coherent legal framework, including a European procedural law and a specialized criminal tribunal, to ensure legal certainty and avoid forum shopping. It highlighted the importance of training for EPPO staff and cooperation with national judiciaries, while urging the Council to prioritize thorough evaluation over rushed implementation and to enhance Member States’ judicial efficiency to support the EPPO’s success.",

The Parliament urged the Commission to suspend the Privacy Shield by 1 September 2018 unless the US addressed deficiencies, such as ensuring judicial redress, prohibiting bulk surveillance, and clarifying national security definitions. It warned of potential CJEU invalidation, referencing ongoing cases (Schrems II), and stressed the need for binding reforms to align US practices with GDPR and EU Charter standards, emphasizing that commercial interests must not override fundamental rights.",

This visa would allow third-country nationals at risk of persecution or harm to enter a Member State solely to apply for asylum, complementing—not replacing—existing national humanitarian entry schemes and resettlement programs. The proposed visa would require streamlined procedures: applications via embassies/consulates, security screenings, a 15-day processing window, appeal rights, and gender-sensitive assessments recognizing persecution based on gender-based violence (e.g., rape, forced marriage). Financial solidarity under Article 80 TFEU was emphasized, with EU funds covering costs, mirroring resettlement compensation.

The resolution condemned forced evictions, segregation in substandard housing (e.g., 10,000 Roma evicted in France in 2016), segregated healthcare and education (e.g., 30.9% of Roma pupils in Czech special schools), and statelessness affecting thousands. It urged Member States to establish national and EU-level truth and reconciliation commissions to address historical persecution, enforce existing anti-discrimination laws (e.g., Racial Equality Directive), and allocate at least 20% of ESF resources to marginalized groups. The Parliament called for desegregation measures, improved Roma participation in policymaking, gender-sensitive strategies addressing intersectional discrimination against Roma women (e.g., forced sterilizations and healthcare neglect), and mandatory anti-bias training for public officials. It stressed the need for robust monitoring of EU funds, enhanced hate crime reporting, and a revised post-2020 EU Roma strategy prioritizing anti-Gypsyism. Additionally, it demanded restitution for Holocaust survivors, recognition of 2 August as Roma Holocaust Memorial Day, and urgent action to end statelessness, ensure birth registration, and provide equal access to utilities and justice.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the EU’s aging population, projecting that a third of its population will be over 65 by 2050, leading to significant labor shortages across all skill levels. It emphasized the need for new legal migration pathways to address these demographic challenges, boost economic competitiveness, and generate potential GDP gains of up to €74 billion annually. The resolution called on the Commission to propose a legislative package by 31 January 2022 to streamline existing legal migration rules, reduce bureaucracy, enhance worker rights, and prevent exploitation. Key proposals included creating a Union-wide talent pool for matching third-country workers with employers, establishing talent partnerships with third countries for skills development and labor mobility, and introducing admission schemes for low- and medium-skilled workers in sectors like agriculture and healthcare. It urged revisions to Directive 2011/98/EU to simplify single permit applications, amendments to Directive 2014/36/EU to allow seasonal workers three months to seek new employment, and updates to Directive 2009/52/EC to extend protections against exploitation to legally residing workers. The Parliament also advocated for a self-employed visa scheme, including a five-year multiple-entry visa, and reforms to Directive 2003/109/EC to reduce the residency requirement for EU long-term status from five to three years and improve intra-EU mobility. Highlighting that 13% of key workers during COVID-19 were immigrants, the resolution stressed the importance of fair treatment, skills recognition frameworks, and addressing labor market mismatches costing 2% in annual productivity. It underscored the need for adequate funding and cooperation with third countries to align migration policies with labor demands while safeguarding fundamental rights.",

It highlighted systemic challenges faced by CSOs, including restrictive laws, stigmatization, harassment, funding shortages, and disproportionate COVID-19 measures that exacerbated existing pressures, with 57% of organizations reporting deteriorated conditions in 2021. The resolution condemned state and non-state attacks on CSOs, particularly those advocating for LGBTIQ+ rights, women’s rights, environmental protection, and migrant support, as well as the rise of government-organized NGOs (GONGOs) undermining genuine civil society. It called for a comprehensive EU civil society strategy, including a \"European civic space index\" within annual rule of law reports, minimum legal standards for CSO operations, and a statute for cross-border associations. The Parliament urged leveraging EU tools like the Conditionality Regulation and infringement procedures to address violations, while stressing the need for sustainable funding, including the €1.55 billion Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values Programme (2021-2027), and non-discriminatory access to resources. It demanded stronger safeguards against strategic lawsuits (SLAPPs), improved civil dialogue mechanisms, and EU guidelines to protect peaceful assembly and online freedoms. The resolution also emphasized the CJEU’s ruling against restrictions on foreign funding (Case C-78/18) and called for measures to ensure cross-border philanthropy, tax incentives for donations, and emergency support for activists at risk.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised support for the European Commission’s draft adequacy decisions recognizing the UK’s data protection framework as essentially equivalent to EU standards under the GDPR and Law Enforcement Directive (LED), while emphasizing the need for rigorous monitoring. It noted the UK’s incorporation of GDPR into national law, retention of EU-derived legislation post-Brexit, and adherence to the ECHR and Convention 108+, but highlighted concerns over potential divergences, including the UK’s 2020 National Data Strategy signaling a shift toward broader data use. The resolution underscored risks posed by UK exemptions, such as the immigration control derogation restricting data subject rights, which was invoked in over 70% of Home Office data requests in 2020 (17,780 requests affecting 146.75 million individuals). It acknowledged UK surveillance reforms under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, including judicial oversight and redress mechanisms, but stressed vigilance over onward data transfers to third countries, particularly the UK-US data-sharing agreement under the CLOUD Act. The Parliament welcomed the inclusion of a four-year sunset clause in the adequacy decisions, requiring reassessment by 2025, and urged the Commission to suspend or repeal decisions if UK standards weaken, prioritizing legal certainty for businesses and safeguarding EU citizens’ rights. It also emphasized the UK’s exclusion from EU databases like the Schengen Information System and called for ongoing scrutiny of UK law enforcement practices to ensure compliance with EU data protection principles.",

Since 2018, at least 47 journalists and 68 human rights defenders have been murdered, with impunity rates around 95% for such crimes, perpetuated by corruption, inadequate judicial reforms, and collusion between authorities and criminal groups. The resolution condemned President López Obrador’s stigmatizing rhetoric against independent media and his administration’s use of state platforms to attack critics, exacerbating risks for journalists. It highlighted severe deficiencies in Mexico’s Federal Protection Mechanism, which safeguards 1,518 individuals (1,023 defenders and 495 journalists) but suffers from underfunding, delays, and poor coordination, leading to at least nine deaths among those under protection. The Parliament urged Mexico to strengthen institutions, implement international standards, and adopt gender-sensitive strategies to protect activists and journalists, while addressing legislative threats like a proposed NGO funding ban and concerning electoral reforms. It emphasized the EU-Mexico Global Agreement’s human rights clauses and called for prioritizing the Escazú Agreement’s implementation to protect environmental defenders.
