It emphasized the need for transparent recruitment procedures, merit-based appointments, and sanctions for non-compliance, such as fines or nullification of appointments. The resolution urged member states to support these objectives through national measures and called for annual progress reports. It also stressed the importance of aligning the directive with broader EU gender equality strategies and ensuring its compatibility with internal market principles, while rejecting exemptions for small and medium-sized enterprises. The Parliament further requested that the Commission resubmit the proposal if amended and directed its President to transmit the position to relevant institutions.",

It highlighted the Test-Achats ruling, which invalidated gender-based insurance premiums, mandating unisex pricing in private insurance and pensions since 2012, though disparities persist in medical insurance and protections for pregnant women. Despite full transposition in all 28 Member States, six faced ongoing compliance issues as of 2015, with low awareness of rights, insufficient data collection, and inconsistent enforcement across sectors. Key problem areas included restrictive interpretations of \"goods and services,\" misuse of derogations under Article 4(5) for differential treatment, and inadequate safeguards for maternity and breastfeeding. The resolution urged action to address harassment in transport and collaborative economy platforms, improve accessibility for parents and carers, and integrate gender mainstreaming in sectors like insurance, finance, and transport, where women face barriers in entrepreneurship, loans, and mobility. It called for ratification of the Istanbul Convention, adoption of the stalled 2008 Equal Treatment Directive, and enhanced support for national equality bodies to ensure legal aid, data transparency, and awareness campaigns. Specific measures included harmonizing airline policies for pregnant travelers, ensuring baby-changing facilities, and addressing gender gaps in transport employment (22% female workforce). The collaborative economy’s digital services were stressed as falling under the Directive’s scope, requiring gender-sensitive regulations to prevent harassment and liability gaps.

It emphasized the need to ratify and implement the Istanbul Convention on combating violence against women, address gender-based violence (including online harassment and domestic violence), and ensure adequate funding for women’s shelters and rights organizations. The Parliament called for stronger enforcement of equality laws, gender mainstreaming in policies, and measures to close the gender pay and pension gaps. It urged the EU to unblock stalled directives on gender balance in corporate boards and equal treatment, adopt a comprehensive gender equality strategy, and combat misinformation on abortion. Additionally, the resolution stressed the importance of inclusive sexuality education, gender-responsive budgeting, and economic empowerment initiatives in STEM and entrepreneurship, while condemning the misuse of feminism to incite racism and highlighting the vital role of civil society in advancing women’s rights.",

Despite constituting nearly 50% of the rural working-age population, women represent only 45% of the economically active population, manage 30% of EU farms, and perform 35% of agricultural work, often as unpaid family laborers without social security or professional status. The resolution highlighted structural barriers, including limited access to land ownership (80.1% of spouses lack ownership rights), underutilization of EU funds (only 28% of training beneficiaries and 19% of farm investment beneficiaries are women), and gaps in digital infrastructure (27.8% rural access to next-gen broadband). It called for gender mainstreaming in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), targeted measures under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), and improved access to education, vocational training, and STEM fields to enhance women’s economic empowerment. Key proposals included promoting female entrepreneurship, ensuring social protections (maternity leave, pensions), closing gender pay and pension gaps, and expanding childcare and healthcare services to support work-life balance. The resolution urged Member States to strengthen women’s participation in decision-making bodies, enforce equality legislation, and collect gender-disaggregated data to better inform policies. It also advocated for a European Charter for Women Farmers to address discrimination and recognize their contributions, while stressing the need for sustainable rural development through diversification, green jobs, and digital connectivity to retain populations and enhance resilience.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised grave concerns over the disproportionate impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on women and children, noting over 5 million refugees (90% women and children) fled to the EU and 7.1 million were internally displaced. It highlighted risks of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) as a weapon of war, including reports of rape, trafficking, and the abduction of over 2,300 children to Russia, while condemning these acts as war crimes under international law. The resolution emphasized uneven implementation of the Temporary Protection Directive (TPD), urging full access to rights like healthcare, childcare, and labor market integration, particularly for marginalized groups, including Roma, LGBTIQ+ individuals, and stateless persons. It stressed urgent needs for safe accommodation, sexual and reproductive health services (SRHS)—especially in Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia where legal barriers restrict access to abortion and emergency contraception—and called for EU-wide anti-trafficking measures, including monitoring transit hubs and funding helplines. The Parliament urged gender-sensitive allocation of EU funds (REACT-EU, AMIF, CARE) to support refugees and host countries like Poland and Moldova, which faces strain from 100,000 refugees, while demanding prosecution of SGBV through the ICC. It further advocated for inclusive peace processes, support for civil society, and protection of women human rights defenders, alongside addressing documentation barriers for transgender individuals and ensuring access to essential medicines.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised critical concerns about persistent gender inequalities in the EU, highlighting a 16% gender pay gap, rising to 40% when accounting for employment disparities, and a 37% pension gap. It noted that no EU country has achieved full gender equality, with progress at a slow pace of one point every two years, projecting over 60 years to reach parity. The resolution emphasized systemic issues, including underrepresentation of women in decision-making roles (less than a third of parliamentarians), disproportionate unpaid care work (75% by women), and heightened risks of poverty—20% of women face poverty or social exclusion, exacerbated by COVID-19, which increased gender-based violence (3,500 annual femicides) and labor market dropouts. It stressed intersectional discrimination affecting marginalized groups and called for urgent adoption of stalled initiatives: the 2008 Anti-Discrimination Directive, the 2012 Women on Boards Directive (blocked for seven years), and EU ratification of the Istanbul Convention. The Parliament urged establishing a dedicated Council configuration on gender equality to mainstream intersectional approaches, unblock legislation, harmonize policies, and address gender-based violence as a Eurocrime. It highlighted the need for gender-responsive budgeting in EU funding and recovery plans, improved childcare access to reduce employment gaps, and reinforced data collection to inform targeted policies.",
