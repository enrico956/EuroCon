It called for binding targets, including a 25% reduction in energy consumption by 2020, 42% by 2030, and 75% by 2050, alongside a legislative framework mirroring the Renewable Energy Directive to mobilize comparable investments. The resolution emphasized integrating ICT, smart grids, and metering to optimize renewables, and urged stricter enforcement of the Ecodesign Directive, particularly for imported products, referencing 12 product groups regulated by 2007. It highlighted sector-specific measures, such as promoting combined heat and power (CHP) systems to double efficiency, climate-neutral buildings, and transport reforms, including stricter vehicle standards, public transit, and a European high-voltage grid for renewable energy. Funding proposals included allocating EUR 2 billion annually via national or EU energy efficiency funds, leveraging structural funds, auctioning revenues from emissions trading, and prioritizing efficiency in FP8 research. The Parliament also stressed regional and local action, advocating for ERDF prioritization, technical assistance via ELENA, and initiatives like the Covenant of Mayors, while addressing barriers like upfront costs, split incentives in housing, and energy poverty. It urged harmonizing policies across sectors, improving consumer communication, combating rebound effects, and merging directives like Ecodesign and Energy Labelling to streamline implementation. Additionally, the resolution called for integrating efficiency into public procurement, waste heat recovery, industrial processes, and education, while critiquing slow progress on key Ecodesign measures and insufficient political support from the Commission.",

It noted global liquefaction capacity could rise from 380 bcm (2011) to 540 bcm by 2020, with US shale gas lowering prices and affecting EU competitiveness, as US spot prices hit historic lows. Projections indicated EU gas imports could reach 450 bcm by 2035 due to declining domestic production. The resolution stressed shale gas might reduce reliance on coal and support the EU’s 2050 decarbonization goals (80-95% GHG reduction), contingent on environmental impact assessments, adherence to EU legislation (e.g., REACH, Water Framework Directive), and methane emission controls. It called for life-cycle GHG analyses, mandatory transparency on fracking chemicals, public consultation, and \"polluter pays\" liability. Member States were urged to adopt robust regulatory frameworks, one-stop licensing, and best practices (e.g., water testing, waste management), while the Commission was tasked with evaluating shale gas’s economic and environmental viability, fostering EU-US cooperation on LNG markets, and promoting CCS development. The Parliament highlighted the need for infrastructure investment, skilled labor, and alignment with renewable energy goals, cautioning against unrealistic expectations given higher EU costs and population density compared to the US.",

Eligibility criteria require projects to prevent third-country control over sensitive information and intellectual property, ensure EU ownership, and contribute to defence capability priorities. Award criteria focus on technological excellence, industrial performance, innovation, SME participation, and commitments by Member States to jointly procure developed products. The Parliament reduced the proposed budget from €500 million to €355 million, reallocating €145 million to digital initiatives under the Connecting Europe Facility. It excluded funding for weapons of mass destruction, banned munitions, fully autonomous weapons, and export-driven small arms projects lacking Member State demand. Participation thresholds were increased to eight undertakings and six Member States per project to deepen cooperation, with flexibility for third-country involvement in exceptional cases. Funding rates were adjusted to 50% for non-prototyping actions (100% for SMEs) and mandatory annual evaluations were introduced to assess the programme’s effectiveness as a pilot for future initiatives.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about escalating cyber threats amid rapid digital transformation, noting the projected 22.3 billion IoT devices by 2024 and vulnerabilities exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in healthcare. It emphasized the need for secure-by-design principles for all internet-connected products, harmonized EU legislation to prevent market fragmentation, and mandatory security updates for outdated software, urging a 2023 proposal for horizontal cybersecurity requirements. The resolution highlighted quantum computing risks, advocating for post-quantum algorithm research, and stressed embedding cybersecurity in EU-funded digital projects, leveraging programs like Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe Programme. It endorsed secure 5G networks, DNS4EU for resilient internet infrastructure, and IPv6 adoption while warning against vendor lock-in. The Parliament called for reducing foreign tech dependency, enhancing strategic resilience in critical sectors like cloud computing and chips, and establishing a Joint Cyber Unit for cross-border collaboration. It urged improved cyber-literacy, addressing the 20% workforce gap since 2015 and the gender disparity (90% male workforce), and supported SMEs through ENISA-led self-testing portals and funding. The resolution also emphasized certification frameworks, including high-assurance cloud security standards, and stressed protecting democratic processes from hybrid threats like disinformation and cyberattacks.",
