Citing evidence from national surveys and laboratory tests, the resolution emphasized that such practices mislead consumers, undermine trust in the single market, and constitute unfair commercial practices under Directive 2005/29/EC (UCPD). It welcomed the Commission’s allocation of €2 million to the Joint Research Centre (JRC) to develop a harmonized testing methodology by end-2018, alongside initiatives like the New Deal for Consumers, which proposes amending the UCPD to explicitly prohibit marketing products as identical when their composition differs significantly. The resolution called for stricter enforcement, cross-border cooperation among national authorities, penalties for non-compliance, and transparency measures such as a public database of test results. It urged manufacturers to avoid misleading packaging, clearly inform consumers of regional recipe variations, and consider EU-wide quality logos, while stressing that product differentiation must not lower quality or exploit purchasing power disparities.

The resolution expressed concern over fragmented governance structures, insufficient transparency in reporting delays, and risks posed by the UK’s withdrawal, urging no loopholes in customs controls post-Brexit. It called for streamlined IT project management, binding milestones, and increased funding, including €842.8 million (2018 prices) for the 2021-2027 Customs Programme, alongside national resource commitments. The Parliament stressed harmonizing controls to prevent trade distortions like \"forum shopping,\" enhancing SME accessibility, and addressing rising low-value e-commerce imports (growing 10-15% annually). It advocated for improved coordination with international bodies like the WTO and WCO, stronger anti-fraud measures, and potential expansion of the Customs Union to Eastern Partnership countries. Lastly, it urged the Commission to ensure transparent progress reporting, avoid repeated delays, and prioritize sovereignty in customs IT infrastructure to secure EU economic, fiscal, and security interests.",

UTPs—including forced payments for non-beneficial services, territorial supply constraints, late payments, and exploitative pricing—stem from power imbalances exacerbated by market concentration, with large retailers and processors leveraging dominance over weaker suppliers. The sector, vital to the EU economy, employs 47 million people, contributes 7% of EU GDP (€1.05 billion market value), and faces crises in dairy, meat, and produce sectors due to unsustainable practices like selling below production costs. Despite voluntary initiatives like the Supply Chain Initiative (SCI), which lacks enforcement, anonymity, and farmer participation, UTPs persist, causing reduced investment, innovation, and food waste while limiting consumer choice. The resolution urges binding EU legislation to prohibit UTPs, enforce fair practices, and establish independent national enforcement bodies with investigatory powers, modeled after the UK Groceries Code Adjudicator, to ensure confidential complaints and penalties. It emphasizes strengthening producer organizations (POs) for collective bargaining, enhancing transparency via price monitoring tools, and revising competition rules to address retailer-owned brands’ anti-competitive risks.

The resolution called for swift adoption of the Commission’s proposal for a color-coded risk map (green, orange, red, grey) based on regional ECDC data, updated weekly, to guide travel restrictions and ensure transparency. It urged Member States to align quarantine periods, testing protocols (including 15-minute rapid tests), and definitions of COVID-19 cases and deaths, while ensuring mutual recognition of tests and minimizing travel disruptions for essential workers. The Parliament advocated for interoperable contact-tracing apps by October 2020, harmonized passenger locator forms compliant with data protection rules, and a European Health Response Mechanism (EHRM) to strengthen crisis preparedness. It highlighted the economic impact of border closures, urging refunds for canceled flights under Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, resilient supply chains for critical goods, and swift implementation of Next Generation EU recovery funds. The resolution emphasized restoring a fully functional Schengen area, avoiding prolonged internal border controls, and protecting consumer rights against scams and unsafe products. It called for a \"resilient Europe\" strategy to bolster healthcare systems, secure medical supplies, and ensure the internal market’s sustainability, while upholding proportionality, non-discrimination, and fundamental rights in all measures.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about persistent barriers undermining the EU Single Market, which sustains 56 million jobs and 25% of EU GDP, with the agri-food sector as the largest manufacturing employer. It highlighted non-tariff barriers (NTBs), including regulatory disparities, inconsistent enforcement of EU law, territorial supply constraints (TSCs), and administrative burdens disproportionately affecting SMEs—71% of which faced market access denials under mutual recognition systems. The resolution urged stronger enforcement via tools like SOLVIT and the Single Digital Gateway, harmonization of standards, and addressing gaps in services sector integration, noting 24 identified restrictions under the Services Directive. It called for eliminating discriminatory practices, enhancing mutual recognition of professional qualifications, and improving digitalization, including the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. The Parliament stressed aligning Single Market policies with climate neutrality and social rights, while addressing COVID-19 impacts through measures like the EU Digital COVID Certificate and a proposed Single Market Emergency Instrument. It criticized Member States for pandemic-related trade barriers and insufficient implementation of EU law, citing 800 single-market infringement cases in 2019. The resolution emphasized the need for coordinated enforcement, transparency in the Single Market Enforcement Taskforce (SMET), and leveraging NextGenerationEU funds to strengthen resilience, innovation, and e-government solutions.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the urgent need to transition towards a sustainable single market by enhancing product durability, repairability, and consumer rights, aligning with the European Green Deal and circular economy goals. It emphasized integrating sustainability with competitiveness, urging measures to combat planned obsolescence, including clear pre-contractual information on product lifespan (determined via objective, real-use metrics) and reparability, alongside harmonized labeling schemes like a repair score or environmental performance index. The resolution highlighted that 79% of EU citizens support mandatory repairability for digital devices, while 59% were unaware of the EU’s two-year legal guarantee, underscoring the need for better consumer education. It called for a \"right to repair,\" including free access to repair information, standardized spare parts, reasonable pricing, and incentives for repair over replacement, alongside extending legal guarantees to match product lifespans. The Parliament advocated for stricter market surveillance to ensure compliance with EU standards, particularly for e-commerce, and proposed a digital \"product passport\" to track sustainability metrics. It urged binding measures to prevent the destruction of reusable goods, promoted second-hand markets through transferred guarantees, and stressed green public procurement to drive demand for sustainable products. Addressing misleading environmental claims (\"greenwashing\"), the resolution demanded stricter enforcement and transparency, supported by 77% of citizens preferring repair to replacement. Funding via the Single Market Programme and R&D investments were emphasized to support SMEs, innovation, and awareness campaigns, while digital infrastructure’s environmental footprint was flagged for assessment. The Parliament also highlighted the role of sustainable public procurement in reducing supply chain dependencies and fostering climate neutrality, urging ambitious sector-specific criteria and reporting mechanisms.",
