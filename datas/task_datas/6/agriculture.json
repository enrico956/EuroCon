It criticized the inadequacy of current CAP tools, with only 2% of rural development funds and 0.4% of the total CAP budget allocated to risk management, and highlighted slow implementation of crisis measures like the single CMO and underused crisis reserves. The resolution urged stronger EU-wide risk management strategies, including sector-specific insurance, mutual funds, tax-deferred savings, and enhanced market transparency through price observatories to track supply chains and curb speculation. It called for revising competition rules to empower farmers via cooperatives and contractual negotiations, addressing imbalances in the food supply chain, and boosting crisis prevention with countercyclical aids and a reformed crisis reserve funded outside the EU budget. The Parliament stressed the need to maintain decoupled direct payments as income stabilizers, ensure fair competition against global rivals like the US, Brazil, and China, and prioritize food autonomy, sustainability, and support for vulnerable regions. Proposals included improving market data accessibility, training farmers in risk management, and leveraging synergies between CAP and other EU policies to stabilize markets, protect incomes, and foster generational renewal in agriculture.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about unfair trading practices (UTPs) in the agricultural supply chain and proposed measures to strengthen protections for suppliers, including extending the scope of the directive to cover all agricultural products (not just food) and suppliers beyond SMEs, such as farmers’ organizations, to prevent trade diversion. It expanded the definition of \"buyer\" to include operators outside the EU active in the EU market, aiming to close loopholes, and introduced definitions for \"unfair trading practices\" (based on economic dependence) and \"economic dependence\" to clarify power imbalances. Key provisions included a 60-day payment term for non-perishable products, aligning with existing late payment rules, and a 60-day notice period for cancellations of perishable goods orders. Enforcement mechanisms required authorities to investigate complaints within 60 days and conclude within 6 months (extendable to 14 months in complex cases), mandate termination of prohibited practices, and allow mediation. The resolution also mandated written contracts upon supplier request, permitted collective complaints via representative associations, and required annual member state reports evaluating the effectiveness of anti-UTP measures. Exemptions were introduced for contributions to producer organizations and quality-related inter-branch agreements.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the inconsistent implementation of EU animal welfare legislation for food-producing animals, including Directives 98/58/EC (general farming), 1999/74/EC (laying hens), 2007/43/EC (broiler chickens), 2008/119/EC (calves), and 2008/120/EC (pigs). While directives on pigs, calves, and laying hens spurred positive structural changes, the general and broiler directives had limited impact due to vague requirements, insufficient monitoring, and excessive member state discretion, leading to uneven enforcement. The resolution highlighted gaps in data quality and consistency, obstructing a clear assessment of on-farm conditions. It urged the Commission to update legislation by incorporating scientific advances and technical progress, emphasizing clarity, detail, and uniform interpretation rather than stricter rules. Additionally, the Parliament noted the absence of consensus on mandatory EU-wide animal welfare labeling, as existing voluntary private systems vary widely and blend welfare with traceability or sustainability. It called for pragmatic labeling frameworks that balance market flexibility and stakeholder input, stressing the need to distinguish between legislative objectives (often overly broad) and practical measures, many of which are already implemented. Future revisions must involve farmers, national authorities, and the Parliament to align rules with realistic farming and commercial practices.",
