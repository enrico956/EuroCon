It emphasized active ageing as a societal asset, promoting intergenerational solidarity, non-discrimination, and lifecycle approaches to health, employment, and social inclusion. Key priorities included combating age-based discrimination in employment (noting Council Directive 2000/78/EC), reducing the 39% gender pension gap, and addressing poverty risks affecting 21% of older women. The resolution highlighted the need for accessible digital technologies, given 69% of those lacking basic digital skills are over 55, and urged inclusive strategies for the Digital Single Market. It called for sustainable pension systems, noting 75 million Europeans rely on occupational pension funds worth €2.5 trillion, and stressed reforms to ensure adequacy and equity, particularly for women. The Parliament advocated for EU-wide policies to support older workers through lifelong learning, generational mentoring, and workplace adaptations, while rejecting sole reliance on raising retirement ages. It endorsed the \"silver economy\" as a growth driver, urged improved healthcare access, and recommended EU strategies on dementia, demographic decline, and elder rights, including a potential UN Convention. Member States were urged to enhance public infrastructure, transport accessibility, and volunteering programs, leveraging EU funds like the European Social Fund. The resolution also demanded action on elder abuse, long-term care adequacy, and equitable health reforms, stressing data collection to monitor progress and ensure targeted interventions.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over the disproportionate socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, which exacerbated inequalities, increased poverty, and disproportionately affected women, youth, low-skilled workers, migrants, persons with disabilities, and those in precarious employment. It highlighted a 6.1% economic contraction in 2020, with projected growth of 4.2% in 2021 and 4.4% in 2022, alongside unemployment rates of 7.6% in 2021 and 7% in 2022, remaining above pre-crisis levels. The resolution stressed the urgency of leveraging the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) to align national recovery plans with the European Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR), the Green Deal, and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring reforms and investments prioritize social inclusion, quality job creation, and upward convergence. It called for addressing gender inequality, noting women spent 18.4 hours weekly on unpaid care during lockdowns (compared to men’s 12.1 hours) and advocated for pay transparency, improved care infrastructure, and closing the 21% wage gap in long-term care sectors. The Parliament urged Member States to prioritize youth employment, reskilling, and affordable housing, citing a €57 billion annual investment gap in social housing, and emphasized integrating social and environmental objectives into fiscal policies, including tax reforms to combat avoidance and fund robust welfare systems. It demanded stronger collective bargaining, minimum wage frameworks, and enhanced public health systems to address pandemic-induced labor market disruptions, while ensuring RRF-funded projects avoid exacerbating inequalities and prioritize green and digital transitions that protect workers’ rights and social dialogue.",

The Parliament urged addressing digital divides worsened by pandemic-related distance learning, ensuring mental health support, and promoting inclusive labor policies for parents. It advocated for robust monitoring via the European Semester, disaggregated data collection, and intersectional approaches to tackle discrimination.
