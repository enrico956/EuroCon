It condemned FGM as a form of gender-based violence and child abuse, emphasizing irreversible physical and mental health consequences, including pain, infections, childbirth complications, and death. The resolution urged the UN General Assembly to adopt a binding resolution to end FGM globally, aligning with the African Union’s call, and stressed the need for EU Member States to ratify and enforce comprehensive legislation criminalizing FGM, ensuring prevention, protection, and prosecution measures. It called for increased funding to support civil society programs addressing vulnerable girls, integration of anti-FGM measures into EU development policies via the 2010 Gender Action Plan, and collaboration with UN agencies like UNICEF, WHO, and UNESCO to mainstream FGM eradication efforts. The Parliament emphasized education, community mobilization, and engagement with religious and local leaders to eliminate harmful practices, while urging the Commission to prioritize ending violence against women through targeted funding and cross-border initiatives.",

It highlighted disparities in labor market participation, noting women’s 17.5% average pay gap, underrepresentation in leadership (12% executives, 3% chairs in major companies), and disproportionate impact of austerity on female-dominated public sectors like healthcare and education.

Combating gender-based violence—including domestic abuse, trafficking, and harmful practices—was prioritized, with demands for an EU-wide strategy, a 2015 \"Year to End Violence Against Women,\" and operationalizing a Gender-Based Violence Observatory. The resolution stressed intersectional discrimination against marginalized groups (Roma, migrants, disabled women) and advocated for inclusive policies, sexual/reproductive rights, and equitable access to healthcare, including addressing HIV/AIDS (45% of new infections among women aged 15-24). It called for gender-responsive budgeting, parity in EU institutions, and mainstreaming gender equality in external policies, particularly post-Arab Spring and in conflict zones. Legislative actions included extending paid maternity leave to 20 weeks, mutual recognition of same-sex families, and reforms to ensure fair taxation and social security for single-person households, 60% of which are women.

It highlighted a 17% gender pay gap, higher female unemployment rates in some Member States, and women’s overrepresentation in precarious, part-time, and low-paid sectors, leading to pension disparities and a 12% lower labor participation rate for mothers compared to childless women. The resolution emphasized the lack of gender perspective in crisis responses, noting that only 5% of decision-makers in EU financial institutions are women, and austerity cuts to public services, healthcare, and welfare disproportionately burden women, increasing unpaid care work and vulnerability to poverty, particularly for single mothers and older women. It called for integrating gender equality into all policies, including employment, economic governance, and social protection; leveraging EU funds like the European Social Fund for childcare, training, and anti-poverty programs; addressing labor market segregation; and promoting female entrepreneurship and decision-making roles. The Parliament urged Member States to ensure equal pay, ratify ILO Convention 189 on domestic workers, revise pension systems to eliminate gender biases, and implement gender budgeting to assess fiscal policies. It stressed the need for affordable childcare, parental leave reforms, and measures to combat gender-based violence exacerbated by economic hardship, while advocating for gender-responsive recovery strategies to achieve Europe 2020 targets, including reducing female poverty and enhancing women’s access to quality jobs and social services.",

It emphasized the need for affordable, high-quality care services, highlighting unmet Barcelona targets (33% childcare for under-threes and 90% for ages three to school age, achieved by only 12 Member States) and insufficient public investment amid aging demographics (30% over 65 by 2060). The resolution urged Member States to enhance care infrastructure, adopt EU directives on work-life balance with paid leave and flexible arrangements, and prioritize gender mainstreaming. It called for improved data collection, quality standards for care services, and increased funding via EU instruments like the European Social Fund+, while addressing precarious conditions in care work and supporting informal carers through training, social protections, and \"care credits\" for pensions. The Parliament stressed the link between accessible care services, women’s labor participation, and economic growth, advocating for policies to reduce poverty risks, particularly for single mothers and disadvantaged groups.",

Despite full transposition in all 28 Member States, six faced ongoing compliance issues as of 2015, with low awareness of rights, insufficient data collection, and inconsistent enforcement across sectors. Key problem areas included restrictive interpretations of \"goods and services,\" misuse of derogations under Article 4(5) for differential treatment, and inadequate safeguards for maternity and breastfeeding. The resolution urged action to address harassment in transport and collaborative economy platforms, improve accessibility for parents and carers, and integrate gender mainstreaming in sectors like insurance, finance, and transport, where women face barriers in entrepreneurship, loans, and mobility. It called for ratification of the Istanbul Convention, adoption of the stalled 2008 Equal Treatment Directive, and enhanced support for national equality bodies to ensure legal aid, data transparency, and awareness campaigns. Specific measures included harmonizing airline policies for pregnant travelers, ensuring baby-changing facilities, and addressing gender gaps in transport employment (22% female workforce).

The resolution demanded the immediate adoption of a formal Communication on a 2016-2020 Strategy for Gender Equality and Women’s Rights, addressing violence against women, workplace inequality, decision-making, health, education, media representation, and external relations, aligned with the Beijing +20 agenda and the EU’s external gender framework (2016-2020). It called for legislative initiatives to eliminate persistent inequalities and proposed an EU summit to assess progress and renew commitments ahead of the March 2016 EPSCO Council meeting.",

It called for gender mainstreaming in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), targeted measures under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), and improved access to education, vocational training, and STEM fields to enhance women’s economic empowerment. Key proposals included promoting female entrepreneurship, ensuring social protections (maternity leave, pensions), closing gender pay and pension gaps, and expanding childcare and healthcare services to support work-life balance. The resolution urged Member States to strengthen women’s participation in decision-making bodies, enforce equality legislation, and collect gender-disaggregated data to better inform policies.

It highlighted that 20,000 women and girls from female genital mutilation (FGM)-practicing countries seek asylum annually, with 71% being survivors of FGM, and stressed the need for gender-sensitive asylum procedures, including recognizing gender-based persecution (e.g., rape, FGM, forced marriage) as valid grounds for protection. The resolution called for safe, legal asylum routes to reduce reliance on smugglers, improved reception conditions with gender-segregated facilities, childcare during interviews, trauma counseling, and access to sexual/reproductive healthcare, including safe abortion. It urged Member States to ratify the Istanbul Convention, ensure women’s independent asylum claims, prohibit detention of vulnerable groups (children, pregnant women, trafficking survivors), and enhance integration through labor market access, education, and family reunification. The Parliament demanded gender-disaggregated data collection, training for asylum officials on trauma and LGBTI-specific needs, and accountability for rights violations at borders. It emphasized compliance with international obligations, including non-refoulement, and prioritized equitable burden-sharing among Member States to address systemic gaps in protection and inclusion.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the persistent gender gap in STEM and digital sectors, noting that women constitute 57.7% of EU tertiary graduates but only 36% of STEM graduates, 18% of ICT professionals, and 15% of top academic positions in STEM fields. It highlighted systemic barriers such as gender stereotypes, workplace discrimination, sexual harassment (55% of EU women face harassment since age 15), and socioeconomic inequalities, which hinder women’s participation and contribute to a gender pay gap and pension gap. The resolution emphasized that closing the STEM gender gap could boost EU GDP per capita by 2.2–3.0% by 2050. It called for integrating gender equality into education policies, including early STEM exposure, teacher training to counter biases, and promoting female role models. The Parliament urged measures to address AI and algorithmic biases by ensuring diverse development teams and gender-disaggregated data, alongside ethical frameworks to prevent discrimination. It stressed the need for work-life balance policies, including childcare support and the implementation of the Work-Life Balance Directive, to retain women in STEM careers. Entrepreneurship initiatives were highlighted, with women representing only 17% of start-up founders and receiving 2% of venture capital, prompting calls for dedicated funding, mentorship, and the expansion of programs like the EU Prize for Women Innovators. The resolution also emphasized addressing intersectional discrimination, improving digital access for marginalized groups, and leveraging EU funds (Erasmus+, ESF+) to support women’s education and career transitions. Finally, it urged the adoption of the Women on Boards Directive and stronger enforcement of pay transparency to advance gender equality in leadership and innovation-driven sectors.",
