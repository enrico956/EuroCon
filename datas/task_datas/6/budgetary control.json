It welcomed the €10 billion capital increase approved in 2012, enabling an additional €60 billion in EU lending (a 49% expansion) for 2013-2015, aiming to unlock €180 billion in investments, particularly for SMEs, infrastructure, innovation, and low-carbon initiatives under the Europe 2020 strategy. Concerns were highlighted over low EIB lending in crisis-hit Programme Countries (e.g., Greece, Ireland), where 2013 targets reached only €5 billion (8% of total EU lending), and the Bank’s risk-averse approach, urging enhanced risk-taking and transparency. The resolution emphasized boosting SME financing, citing 2013 targets of €19 billion for SMEs and mid-caps, alongside blended instruments like the Growth and Employment Facility and Project Bond Initiative (supported by €230 million from the EU budget), which approved nine infrastructure projects. Climate priorities were stressed, including the EIB’s new Emissions Performance Standard for fossil fuels and demands for a phase-out plan for non-renewable energy lending. Youth employment programs, such as the €6 billion Youth Employment Initiative, were noted, alongside calls for improved governance, compliance with anti-tax evasion standards, and cooperation with institutions like the EBRD and World Bank (jointly committing €30 billion for 2013-2014).

It noted the Court’s administrative budget of €148.6 million (93% implementation rate), with 80% allocated to personnel and 20% to operational costs, and emphasized improved utilization of Title 1 (personnel) appropriations (92.3% in 2010) and near-full use of Title 2 (operations) funds (98%). The resolution welcomed a €500,000 annual cost reduction in security services through reorganization and urged the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to expedite investigations into irregularities reported in 2010. It commended the Court’s revised Code of Conduct, including online publication of Members’ financial interests, and its publication of 2 annual reports, 40 special annual reports, 14 special reports, and 6 opinions in 2010, while urging timely evaluation of report impacts. The resolution called for a Special Report on conflicts of interest in four EU agencies by June 2012 and stressed the need for enhanced audit follow-ups and performance indicators. It noted the Court’s 376 audit missions (351 in Member States, including 52 in France and 38 in Germany) and staff composition (889 officials, 48 contract agents), advocating for more audit-focused personnel. Cooperation with Parliament’s Budgetary Control Committee was praised, particularly regarding Joint Undertakings, with a request for a special report on their effectiveness. The resolution also highlighted ongoing reforms, including a pilot project with Eurofound to streamline external audits, and called for an in-depth assessment of the Council’s control systems by end-2012, alongside plans to revise rules for appointing Court members to address future challenges.",

Staffing stood at 66, comprising temporary and contract agents, with calls for transparency on workforce objectives. The resolution praised the Agency’s performance metrics, initiatives like the \"foresight\" project on green jobs’ safety impacts, and proactive sharing of internal audit reports, which identified seven recommendations (two deemed \"very important\") requiring follow-up. Parliament emphasized full implementation of audit recommendations, particularly on accounting system validation, and reiterated satisfaction with the Court’s validation of the Agency’s lawful and regular operations.",

It acknowledged the release of €2 million from this reserve for IT development and infrastructure projects after EFSA fulfilled conditions by submitting a staff opinion survey, while the remaining reserve funds were reallocated to address the H1N1 pandemic, though EFSA postponed recruitment plans using these funds to 2010. The Parliament noted €6 million in canceled payment appropriations due to EFSA’s introduction of differentiated appropriations for science grants and cooperation projects, urging improved budget planning and monitoring. It emphasized the need for EFSA to maintain high-quality, independent scientific advice to uphold EU safety standards, recommending stricter enforcement of internal rules on declarations of interest for staff and experts. Despite these observations, the Parliament granted discharge to EFSA’s Executive Director for the 2009 budget and approved the closure of the accounts, concluding that the Authority’s financial management met requirements for accountability.",

The Court of Auditors found the Agency’s accounts reliable and transactions legal, with EMSA receiving €44.3 million in commitment appropriations and €48.3 million in payment appropriations from the 2009 EU budget. However, the Parliament criticized weak budgetary procedures, including excessive transfers and payment cancellations, reflecting poor planning and monitoring, and a failure to adhere to the principle of annuality. It noted that 85% of procurement procedures were negotiated, raising transparency concerns, though EMSA asserted compliance with Financial Regulation reporting requirements. Recruitment practices were also flagged as non-transparent, despite Agency assurances of updated procedures. The Parliament welcomed EMSA’s adoption of a five-year strategy to address prior audit recommendations and urged further development of Key Performance Indicators. Emphasizing the need for accountability amid proposed new Commission tasks, the resolution called for rigorous, transparent recruitment and improved budgetary discipline to ensure effective resource use.",

However, it criticized the carry-over of €16.2 million (40% of the budget), which undermined the principle of annuality and indicated weaknesses in budget planning. The Parliament noted excessive cash reserves of €16.7 million at year-end, generating €313,000 in interest, with €307,000 returned to the Commission, urging stricter adherence to needs-based cash management. Recruitment delays were flagged, with only 101 of 130 authorized posts filled by 2008, and 16 recruitment processes requiring re-advertisement. Concerns persisted over unresolved seat negotiations with Sweden, including unregulated renovation expenses of €500,000, though progress on personal identity number agreements was acknowledged. The ECDC was faulted for incomplete reporting on internal audits, with six critical recommendations pending, including gaps in scientific advice protocols and financial control standards. The resolution called for improved budget execution, recruitment efficiency, and compliance with procurement rules, while recognizing efforts to enhance organizational structure and operational capacity.",

The resolution highlighted the EEA’s critical role in providing objective environmental data to EU institutions and member states, particularly through €2 million in additional 2008 funding allocated to new tasks mandated by DG Environment, such as advancing climate change policies, refining climate indicators, implementing the Biodiversity Action Plan, developing the Shared Environmental Information System, and supporting the Sustainable Consumption and Production Action Plan. It urged the EEA to enhance public communication to amplify media coverage of its findings on climate change, biodiversity, and resource management, and emphasized the Agency’s importance in evaluating EU environmental legislation compliance both within the EU and in neighboring countries. The Parliament concluded that the financial and operational management for 2008 justified granting discharge to the Executive Director.",

However, the resolution highlighted persistent issues such as high carryover rates (23% of the 2008 budget carried to 2009) due to delays in software development, grants, and scientific cooperation projects, which conflicted with budgetary annuality principles. EFSA’s budget execution reached 97% for commitments and 95% for payments, with a €9 million budget increase from 2007. The Authority was criticized for maintaining excessive cash reserves (€19.99 million as of December 2008) and generating €485,651 in interest income, prompting calls for stricter cash management. Audit findings revealed 80% implementation of internal audit recommendations, though concerns remained over grant management deadlines and recruitment challenges (318 posts filled out of 335 planned). The resolution urged EFSA to adopt SMART objectives, improve budget planning, reduce carryovers, and ensure transparency in post-employment conflicts of interest.

It criticized non-compliance with the Financial Regulation in six cases where budget commitments followed legal obligations, urging adherence. The resolution highlighted necessary revisions to the ITER Financial Regulation, including exceptions to budgetary principles, internal audit alignment, and grant award rules. It urged timely submission of annual activity reports, improved IT risk documentation, and analysis, while noting progress in internal controls, including an internal audit action plan and appointments of a Data Protection Officer. Concerns were raised over high cash holdings (€58.98 million at year-end 2008, generating €216,304.89 in interest), prompting a call for needs-based cash management to minimize reserves. The Parliament approved the closure of the 2008 accounts and granted discharge to the Director, acknowledging the Court of Auditors’ assurance of reliability and legality while emphasizing ongoing operational improvements.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over the rapid expansion of EU agencies, noting their number grew from 11 in 2000 to 29 in 2010, with budget allocations increasing by 610% (€94.7 million to €578.87 million) and staff numbers rising by 271% (1,219 to 4,794), while their share of the EU budget grew from 0.102% to 0.477%. It highlighted systemic weaknesses, including poor financial planning leading to excessive carryovers and budget execution delays, recurrent procurement deficiencies (e.g., lack of market value estimates and contract monitoring), and staffing challenges such as recruitment gaps and reliance on interim staff for sensitive roles. The resolution criticized inefficient governance structures, particularly in small agencies (e.g., European Police College with a 27-member board for 24 staff), and urged rationalization through mergers, shared support services, and common standards for host agreements to address logistical and social inclusion issues. It called for enhanced accountability via activity-based budgeting, performance metrics (SMART objectives, RACER indicators), and mandatory inclusion of annual operational comparisons in audit reports. The Parliament endorsed best practices like the European Food Safety Authority’s audit committee and risk assessment system, the Environment Agency’s real-time management tools, and the Foundation for Living and Working Conditions’ impact monitoring. It stressed the need for the interinstitutional working group on agencies to establish minimum standards, improve governance (e.g., Commission blocking minority votes on management boards), and define director qualifications, while urging the Commission to assist smaller agencies administratively and address cash management inefficiencies.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over the 2010 EU budget’s implementation, noting the Court of Auditors’ finding that payments were free from material error but highlighted quantifiable eligibility errors in intermediate and final expenditure, alongside non-quantifiable risks in procurement and contract extensions, which remain vulnerable to fraud. It stressed the need for improved oversight in External Action/Development/Enlargement policies, where control systems were deemed partially effective, urging the Commission and EEAS to enhance payment regularity and rigorously monitor risks in budget support, including fraud and corruption. While acknowledging inherent risks in external aid, Parliament called for systematic cost/benefit evaluations of interventions, balanced with strategic EU interests, and emphasized donor coordination with Member States and international organizations. In cohesion policy, 18% of expenditure (€10.8 billion commitments, €7.1 billion payments via the European Social Fund) faced a 7.7% error rate, driven by procurement non-compliance; Member States were urged to improve fund management, with scrutiny of financial engineering instruments and support for the Globalisation Fund’s €105 million in projects. Environmental and climate actions achieved 99.26% execution (€240 million for LIFE+ grants), while public health saw 99.7% commitment execution but delays in payments. Parliament criticized customs and VAT evasion vulnerabilities, advocating simplified procurement rules and stronger consumer protection mechanisms, including SOLVIT and the European Consumer Centres. Regional policy disbursed €30.557 billion, with 49% of audited payments error-prone (mainly procurement and eligibility issues), urging simplification and stricter controls. Gender-responsive budgeting was lacking, and Parliament demanded audits assessing gender impacts. Lastly, it highlighted mismanagement in education/culture programs and the abrupt closure of a pan-European TV project without parliamentary consent, demanding transparency. Overall, the resolution underscored the need for enhanced accountability, error reduction, and strategic alignment with EU priorities.",

Concerns were raised over efficiency, with average case processing times for preliminary rulings increasing to 16.4 months (from 16 in 2010), direct actions to 20.2 months (from 16.7), and appeals to 15.4 months (from 14.3). Despite this, the Court completed 550 cases in 2011 (up from 522 in 2010), including 370 judgments and 180 orders. The Parliament praised the ‘e-Curia’ digital system for streamlining document handling and workflows and endorsed ongoing reforms to the Court’s Statute and Rules of Procedure to address caseload challenges, urging swift adoption of measures like appointing additional General Court judges in 2013.",

In environment and climate action, 99.92% of commitments were executed, with LIFE+ allocating €267 million to projects, but DG CLIMA’s payment rate lagged at 58.23%. Transport policy saw high implementation rates (99.85% commitments, 97.03% payments), though TEN-T funding cuts and safety program underspending were criticized. Cohesion policy remained error-prone, with 98 ERDF/Cohesion Fund and 70 ESF payments audited in 2011 containing errors, driven by procurement breaches. Fisheries faced rising error rates, overcapacity from public aid, and flawed fleet register data, while maritime funds achieved 97% commitment execution. Education and culture agencies were praised for procedural simplification but faulted for Lifelong Learning Programme errors. Gender budgeting was demanded to assess equality impacts, with calls for gender-specific data in budget reporting.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns regarding the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) in its 2012 financial management, postponing the discharge decision due to significant shortcomings. The Body’s budget surged by 170.6% to €3.19 million compared to 2011, with 17% (€545,000) of appropriations unused and 19% (€611,000) carried over, reflecting planning and implementation challenges, including delayed recruitments and inefficient handling of mission cost reimbursements. Procurement procedures lacked transparency, with inadequate evaluation criteria and documentation, while recruitment processes suffered from irregularities, such as post-hoc test questions and unapproved selection board changes. Financial controls were criticized: €101,000 from 2011 commitments was canceled, mobile phone allocations (€50/month per staff) lacked usage monitoring, and all €1.6 million in treasury was held in a single BBB-rated bank without a treasury policy. Conflict of interest policies were insufficient, lacking codes of conduct, public declarations, or alignment with EU guidelines, and key personnel’s CVs and interests were undisclosed. The Parliament demanded corrective actions by 1 September 2014, including improved procurement, recruitment, financial planning, conflict management, and public communication of BEREC’s impact on citizens. While acknowledging the Court of Auditors’ assurance of reliable accounts, the resolution emphasized urgent reforms to ensure accountability and operational efficiency.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns and recommendations regarding the 2012 budget implementation and operations of the Court of Auditors, emphasizing transparency, efficiency, and accountability. It granted discharge to the Court’s Secretary-General, noting the Court’s 2012 commitment appropriations totaled €137.3 million (a 96% budget implementation rate) and highlighting its purely administrative nature. The resolution stressed the need for improved audit timeliness, urging the Court to present its annual report by 30 June to streamline discharge procedures and enhance spending effectiveness. It called for better geographical balance in staffing, as newer EU member states remained underrepresented in managerial roles, and urged efficiency gains in support services despite successful recruitment for audit posts. The Parliament welcomed the Court’s external audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which affirmed the reliability of its financial statements, but demanded access to the assurance report on resource regularity and control procedures. It pushed for enhanced performance audits, clearer timelines for Special Reports (noting a reduction from 25 to 20 months since 2008 but expressing regret over unmet 18-month targets), and stricter adherence to deadlines for preliminary findings. The resolution highlighted concerns over translation cost disparities per language and urged alignment with other institutions’ methodologies. It commended the Court’s anti-fraud cooperation with OLAF, citing eight audit-related fraud cases and eight denunciation cases in 2012, leading to nine investigations, and called for detailed reporting on closed OLAF cases. The Parliament also addressed a 2012 harassment case involving a former Court member, urging procedural reviews to safeguard workplace dignity, and welcomed the new Code of Conduct for Court members while advocating a two-term limit for the Court President. Finally, it requested updates on internal audit verifications, human resources allowances, and follow-up actions on Parliament’s recommendations in future reports.",

It noted the EU’s contribution to the Agency’s 2012 budget totaled €38,651,354.83, a 6.95% increase from 2011, and commended EASA’s adherence to financial rules and effective budgetary planning. However, it highlighted irregularities in a recruitment case where a selected candidate lacked required qualifications, urging an explanation. Transparency issues were emphasized, including the absence of publicly accessible CVs and declarations of interests for Management Board members, the Executive Director, and Board of Appeal members, with calls for urgent remediation. The Agency was praised for introducing a one-year \"cooling-off period\" to prevent conflicts of interest but criticized for incomplete ex ante verification documentation and insufficiently risk-based ex post verification sampling in internal controls, demanding corrective actions. The Parliament acknowledged that 22 of 23 prior Internal Audit Service recommendations were implemented but stressed the need for improved IT project management. Finally, it urged EASA to enhance public communication of its impact on citizens, particularly via its website.",

Parliament emphasized the need for legal clarity on discharge procedures, proposing a workshop and treaty amendments to strengthen accountability, and called on the Court of Auditors to audit the Council’s follow-up to these recommendations.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised key points regarding the 2012 financial management of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), approving the closure of its accounts and granting discharge to its Executive Director. The Authority’s 2012 budget was €78.3 million (0.056% of the EU budget), with a 99.3% implementation rate and 88% payment execution. It achieved savings of €3.94 million from relocation, reallocated to scientific activities and staff recruitment. While the Court of Auditors found the accounts reliable, it highlighted risks in accounting system validations (excluding local systems) and high carry-over rates for Titles II (22%, €2.3 million) and III (30%, €5.6 million), urging adherence to annuality principles. EFSA improved conflict-of-interest policies, including post-employment restrictions and a 2011 independence policy, but faced criticism for burdensome procedures, insufficient transparency in expert declarations (e.g., anonymized interests like “private company”), and laxer rules for experts from food safety organizations (FSOs) with potential private funding. Parliament called for stricter cooling-off periods (two years for agrifood sector ties), clearer remuneration disclosures, and exclusion of FSOs with over 50% non-public funding. Staffing improved, with 342 of 355 posts filled and 124 contract agents, while 70% of resources focused on scientific activities. Concerns included the Management Board’s refusal to elect leaders via open ballot and risks in internal controls (data management, IT security). EFSA was urged to enhance public communication, transparency, and structured dialogue with civil society, while addressing audit recommendations on accounting validations and carry-overs.",

The Ombudsman’s 2012 budget totaled €9,516,500, allocated as €7,275,000 for staff (Title 1), €1,656,500 for operational costs (Title 2), and €585,000 for special functions (Title 3), with 98.30% of appropriations committed and 88.69% paid, reflecting a 95.88% utilization rate (up from 92.54% in 2011). Parliament endorsed improved financial planning and commended performance indicators in the Annual Management Plan, while urging continued efficiency. It highlighted unresolved internal audit actions on procurement and internal controls, calling for prompt implementation of recommendations. Noting 85% of complaint admissibility decisions were made within one month (with targets for further improvement) and reduced inquiry durations, Parliament requested clearer reporting on multi-stage inquiries. It welcomed collaboration with the European Foundation for Quality Management and the Ombudsman’s detailed annual impact report but sought explicit disclosure of budget spending on self-promotion and citizen outreach. Parliament also called for unified translation cost methodologies across institutions, transparency on challenges with external audits of European Schools, and inclusion of follow-up reviews in future Court of Auditors reports.",

It emphasized that 70% of Parliament’s commitments were allocated to four key areas: Members’ expenses, staff salaries, buildings, and parliamentary assistance. Despite a 1.9% budget increase from 2011 (€1.685 billion to €1.717 billion), Parliament highlighted its fiscal restraint by staying below the 2.6% inflation rate and urged maintaining this discipline, notably by capping Chapter 5 expenditures at 20% in 2015. The resolution noted efficient budget implementation, with 99% of appropriations committed and a 1% cancellation rate, while criticizing the recurring use of a €45 million \"mopping-up\" transfer for building projects (e.g., Brussels’ Trebel building and Luxembourg’s KAD building), which saved €10.4 million in financing costs but obscured budgetary clarity. It reiterated calls for the Bureau to distribute policy-related \"White Papers\" to Members for pre-decision discussions and highlighted 2012 revenue of €175.5 million, including €22.27 million in assigned revenue.

It referenced cumulative grant agreements totaling €295 million from 2008-2011 calls, a 2012 call for €78 million, and a remaining €68.5 million allocated in 2013, against a maximum EU contribution of €470 million (€20 million for running costs). Concerns included a €12.3 million year-end cash surplus conflicting with budgetary equilibrium principles, urging measures to minimize balances. The resolution criticized the lack of publicly available CVs for management board members and the absence of a conflict-of-interest policy, demanding transparency improvements. It acknowledged the FCH JU’s progress in finalizing a Business Continuity Plan and disaster recovery strategy. Broader observations highlighted Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs) taking two years on average to achieve financial autonomy, with SMEs receiving 21% of JTI funding. The resolution noted the total EU contribution to seven Joint Undertakings as €11.49 billion, with 2012 income at €2.5 billion (1.8% of the EU budget) and staffing at 409 personnel. It called for a comprehensive Court of Auditors review of JTIs to assess added value, efficiency, and reputational risks, stressing the need for robust oversight of long-term industrial research investments.",

The Parliament welcomed simplified financial rules to reduce administrative burdens and called for agencies to adopt cost-saving synergies, shared services, and potential mergers, citing examples like the proposed merger of CEPOL with Europol and collaboration between the European Maritime Safety Agency and European Fisheries Control Agency. It stressed the need for robust conflict-of-interest management, referencing deficiencies in agencies such as EASA, EFSA, and ECHA, and urged compliance with new Commission guidelines requiring public disclosure of declarations of interest and CVs by December 2014. The resolution demanded improved budgetary discipline to minimize carry-overs, enhanced transparency in fee-setting for self-funded agencies, and gender-balanced staffing. It criticized IT systems like ABAC and SYSPER2 as ill-suited for agencies and called for data accessibility reforms. The Parliament also urged the Court of Auditors to expand performance audits and assess agency mergers by 2016, while advocating for annual Commission progress reports on the Common Approach’s implementation and stronger parliamentary scrutiny of agency work programs to align with political priorities.",

It criticized incomplete use of grants by Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), leading to €95,721 in unspent carryovers (16.26% of total carried forward), and noted increased single reimbursement rates for KICs, potentially undermining financial independence. The Parliament urged multi-annual grant agreements post-2020 and stricter adherence to financial rules, citing irregularities in KIC procurement (€2.2 million in 2016 irregularities) and governance lapses. Staffing issues included understaffing (38/41 posts filled), reliance on temporary contracts, and prolonged interim leadership (since 2014), contravening regulations. Positive aspects included a low error rate (0.98% in ex-post verifications), financial autonomy achieved in 2017, and collaboration with other agencies. The resolution demanded corrective actions on governance, procurement, staffing, and grant management, with regular reporting to the discharge authority.",

Staffing concerns included reliance on external expertise amid new tasks without staff increases (583 temporary agents vs. 596 authorized), a €10 million rise in staff costs, and risks from replacing permanent staff with contract agents. The Agency addressed whistleblowing (25 external cases, 10 ongoing), maintained conflict-of-interest safeguards, and improved stakeholder transparency. Internal audits flagged a pharmacovigilance fees deficit, prompting corrective actions. Parliament urged EMA to enhance financial management, mitigate relocation impacts, and ensure operational continuity while fulfilling its public health mandate.",

It welcomed the ETF’s 93% activity completion rate, achievement of 13 out of 14 key performance indicators, and collaboration with EU agencies like Cedefop. Staffing included 85 temporary agents (96.6% establishment plan execution), 40 contract agents, and measures to enhance ethics, anti-fraud awareness, and internal controls, with 10 out of 16 internal control standards needing slight improvements.

While acknowledging ENISA’s progress, including exceeding operational targets under its 2017 Work Programme, collaboration with Member States to implement Directive (EU) 2016/1148 on cybersecurity, and receiving the EU Ombudsman Award for Good Administration, the resolution highlighted concerns such as a 9.39% cancellation of carryovers (€90,916) and a slight decline in payment execution (88.19%). Staffing challenges were noted, including under-execution of the establishment plan (42 out of 48 authorized temporary agents), recruitment difficulties due to contract types and salary correction coefficients in Greece, and inadequate hand-over procedures for the accounting officer. The Parliament urged ENISA to enhance transparency by publishing CVs and conflict-of-interest declarations for all senior management, improve key performance indicators to better assess impact, and address risks related to Brexit and environmental sustainability, including CO² reduction measures. Additionally, the Agency was called on to report on corrective actions for staff centralization, recruitment, and the outcomes of a 2017 external evaluation study covering 2013–2016.",

It noted a clean audit opinion on the accounts and legality of transactions, with commitment appropriations utilization at 97.07% (€322.4 million) but recurring low payment appropriations (71.96%, €206.4 million), attributed to delays in clinical trials, grant agreements, and project timelines. Outstanding payments under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) totaled €246.1 million (25.47% of €966.1 million committed), while Horizon 2020 commitments reached 50% (€819 million of €1.68 billion allocated), with payments at 10.97% (€179.65 million). Industry contributions under FP7 totaled €705.1 million (€529.9 million in-kind, €21.9 million cash) against the EU’s €827.2 million, while Horizon 2020 saw €140.4 million from industry (€82.5 million validated) versus the EU’s €157.3 million. The resolution highlighted inefficiencies in payment forecasting, with €78.7 million in unused appropriations, though corrective measures reduced over-budgeting by €56 million. Performance metrics showed a leverage effect of 0.96 nearing targets, improved SME and patient organization involvement (50% of projects), and management costs below 5%. Anti-fraud efforts aligned with EU standards saw no new OLAF cases, though two inquiries were addressed. Internal audits confirmed compliance, with error rates of 1.29% (FP7) and 0.81% (Horizon 2020), and reduced payment delays (11.1% administrative, 52 days for final payments). Staff increased to 49, and KPIs were revised to better align with objectives. The resolution urged improved payment planning, enhanced participation of associated partners, and timely reporting on Horizon 2020 grant tools.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over the protection of the EU’s financial interests, noting that Member States manage approximately 74% of the EU budget and are primarily responsible for VAT and customs collection, which contributed €18.3 billion to EU revenue in 2015. It highlighted significant challenges, including a 2015 VAT gap of €151.5 billion and cross-border VAT fraud (e.g., carousel fraud) causing annual losses of €50 billion. The resolution welcomed the adoption of the PIF Directive, criminalizing large-scale VAT fraud (threshold: €10 million), and the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) by 20 Member States, urging others to join and ensuring cooperation with OLAF and Eurojust. It criticized the UK for undervaluing imports from China, leading to a €1.987 billion recovery recommendation by OLAF, and called for improved tracking of fraud-related recoveries. Parliament expressed alarm over tobacco smuggling (€10 billion annual loss) and urged ratification of the WHO Protocol to combat illicit trade. It emphasized the need for harmonized anti-fraud strategies, simplified EU financial rules, and digitalization of fund management. Whistleblower protection was deemed critical, with calls for EU-wide legislation. Corruption’s economic and democratic impact was stressed, alongside demands for transparency in public procurement and anti-money laundering measures. OLAF’s role was scrutinized, citing low prosecution rates (30%) of its cases and insufficient follow-up by Member States. The resolution urged stronger customs checks, addressing irregularities in cohesion and agricultural funds, and improving data quality in fraud reporting. It also called for ending tobacco industry agreements and enhancing tobacco tracking under the Tobacco Products Directive. Overall, the resolution prioritized closing legal gaps, boosting cross-border cooperation, and safeguarding EU finances through prevention, detection, and prosecution reforms.",

It highlighted persistent issues with carryovers, including a 28% cancellation rate for committed appropriations carried into 2013 (down from 45% in 2012) and a reduction in unused appropriations from 17% to 14.6%, while calling for stricter planning to lower carryover amounts (e.g., EUR 461,983 in 2013).

It acknowledged internal control improvements, including asset inventory protocols and alignment with EU financial regulations, while urging continued compliance with audit standards and measurable performance targets. The Office was also urged to boost public visibility of its EU-funded activities by prominently displaying EU logos and communicating its impact on citizens.",

The resolution highlighted delays in procurement, insufficient monitoring of cost deviations, and inadequate transparency in financial statements, particularly the lack of detailed progress indicators for work-in-progress. It criticized the Joint Undertaking’s 89.8% payment appropriation utilization rate (57.8% against the initial budget) and late membership contributions totaling €2.2 million. Additional concerns included unresolved conflicts of interest, incomplete staff regulations, poor working conditions impacting recruitment, and delays in finalizing permanent premises under the Host State Agreement with Spain. The Parliament urged urgent corrective actions, including realistic project scheduling, enhanced procurement competitiveness, timely reporting on stakeholder commitments, cost containment measures, and improved internal controls. It also called for clarity on intellectual property rights management and stricter oversight of contractors to protect EU interests in fusion research outcomes.",

Eurojust’s final 2013 budget was €33.8 million, with a 1.85% decrease in EU contributions compared to 2012. The Court of Auditors affirmed the reliability of accounts and legality of transactions but noted weaknesses, including high carry-overs of €2.3 million (32% of operational expenditure) due to delayed software management transitions. Parliament criticized 49 budget transfers affecting 101 lines, reflecting poor planning, and urged streamlined processes. Eurojust introduced measures to reduce carry-overs, such as forecasting reports and financial training, and revised recruitment procedures to ensure pre-defined evaluation criteria. Internal audits revealed high inherent risks in control systems, with management action plans deemed insufficiently addressed. Parliament emphasized the need for stricter adherence to sound financial management principles, particularly annuality, to ensure economical, efficient, and effective use of resources in combating serious cross-border crime.",

Key demands included separating the European Council and Council budgets, adopting anti-corruption guidelines, integrity rules, codes of conduct, whistleblowing mechanisms, and public declarations of financial interests for Council members. It urged improved budgetary planning with performance indicators, transparency in legislative processes (including trilogues), and disclosure of delayed Europa building costs. The Parliament reiterated its Treaty-based authority to grant discharge individually to all institutions, called for Treaty revisions to clarify this mandate, and pressed the Commission to amend the Financial Regulation to enforce accountability and sanctions. Overall, the resolution emphasized the need for the Council to align with transparency standards, ensure sincere inter-institutional cooperation, and uphold democratic accountability to EU citizens.",

It highlighted the EEAS’s 2014 budget of €518.6 million (€212.9 million for headquarters, €305.7 million for delegations), with 65% of headquarters funds allocated to staff salaries and 33.7% of delegation funds for statutory staff remuneration. Key issues included persistent gender imbalances in senior roles (16% female senior management at headquarters, 23% female heads of delegation) and overrepresentation of diplomats from pre-2004 Member States in delegation leadership (46% of heads, with only 20 from post-2004 states). The resolution urged reforms to simplify rigid budget structures, reduce administrative burdens on delegation heads, and address recurring errors in staff allowances and procurement, particularly in security services. It called for improved staffing balance between EU institutions and Member States, reduced reliance on seconded national experts (407 in 2014), and better integration of EU Special Representatives into EEAS structures. Concerns were raised about accountability in external assistance programs, including mismanagement risks in Afghanistan’s Law and Order Trust Fund, and delays in finalizing whistleblower guidelines. The Parliament emphasized the need for streamlined crisis response mechanisms, enhanced coordination with Member States on foreign policy, and cost-effective Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions, including adequate security budgeting. It welcomed progress in co-location agreements (17 new memoranda in 2014, totaling 50) but urged further evaluation of delegation efficiency. Lastly, the resolution stressed the urgency of implementing lessons from the EULEX mission and requested the Court of Auditors to monitor EEAS compliance with these recommendations.",

The Court of Auditors found no significant weaknesses in human resources or procurement, affirming payments were free from material error. The resolution welcomed the Ombudsman’s systemic approach through own-initiative inquiries and the creation of a dedicated coordinator role but urged regular reporting on their impact. It flagged underperformance in key performance indicators, including slower case closures (12- and 18-month targets) and delayed admissibility decisions, urging mitigation strategies. Concerns included high complaints outside the Ombudsman’s mandate (notably from Spain and Poland), calling for improved communication and cooperation with national ombudsmen. Staff satisfaction dipped in 2014 due to organizational changes, though corrective measures were taken. The resolution criticized excessive travel (212 missions costing €186,000 total) and urged greater use of videoconferencing to reduce costs and CO2 emissions. Recruitment practices faced scrutiny for bypassing standard procedures in hiring three temporary staff, demanding alignment with EU civil service standards. Gender imbalances persisted in AST posts (21 men vs. 9 women) and management (9 men vs. 2 women), requiring medium-term targets. Transparency improvements were sought, including detailed HR breakdowns by nationality and gender, disclosure of OLAF investigation outcomes, and unused interpretation rates. Savings on translation and publications were welcomed, while potential €195,000 savings from a single seat were noted, urging inclusion in Parliament’s centralization debates.

Budget execution rates were 98.65% for commitments and 75.59% for payments, with 34% (€443,412) of Title II administrative funds carried over, mainly for new premises setup, IT contracts, and audit services. The Agency maintained compliance with financial rules, completed five recruitments, and revised conflict-of-interest policies, though further transparency and staff awareness were urged. An internal audit plan was in place, and a Staff Regulations error causing a €5,300 underpayment to an official was rectified. The Agency’s relocation to new premises in 2014 improved working conditions, reduced rental costs, and secured long-term stability via a Spanish seat agreement. Parliament commended the Agency’s role in implementing the 2014–2020 EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety, highlighting achievements in risk assessment tools, the Healthy Workplaces Campaign, and its multiannual strategic program’s first-year progress in areas like anticipating workplace changes and knowledge-sharing. Cooperation with Member States and efficient budget management were acknowledged, though carry-over levels and ongoing policy revisions required attention.",

It highlighted a 97.1% budget implementation rate and a 91.1% payment execution rate, alongside reduced carry-overs of committed appropriations to €5.9 million (6.2% of budget), though operational carry-overs (38.1%) were justified by multi-annual projects. Procurement issues were flagged, including delayed framework contract renewals leading to non-compliant extensions and negotiated procedures, prompting calls for improved planning. Staffing adjustments were noted, with 78.7% of roles dedicated to operational tasks, while concerns persisted over transparency in outsourcing and funding-linked staff cuts. The Parliament acknowledged anti-fraud measures, whistleblower procedures, and conflict-of-interest policies but urged enhanced awareness and safeguards. Internal audits revealed 56 recommendations, with corrective actions underway. Criticisms included the lack of a headquarters agreement with the host state (Germany) despite 15 years of operations, risking legal clarity and operational efficiency. The Agency’s role in addressing 2014 aviation crises (e.g., MH370, MH17) and reforms toward performance-based safety were recognized, alongside calls for adequate resources without compromising independence. Discharge was granted contingent on addressing these issues, particularly procurement compliance, carry-over reductions, and finalizing the headquarters agreement.",

The resolution emphasized strict procurement rules to avoid conflicts of interest, particularly with regulated industries, and criticized EFSA’s initial refusal to implement a two-year cooling-off period for experts with industry ties, though it acknowledged later steps for panel renewals. Transparency improvements were urged, including centralizing declarations of interest (with a 2016 deadline), prohibiting anonymized declarations, and ensuring public access to scientific data in machine-readable formats. The Parliament noted underpayments of €87,000 to eight officials (2005–2014) and called for corrective measures. It welcomed EFSA’s 2013 transparency initiative, enhanced stakeholder engagement, and compliance with Court of Auditors’ recommendations, while stressing the need for stronger anti-fraud strategies and internal controls, particularly in IT security and staff evaluations. Despite concerns over independence challenges due to insufficient funding, the Parliament approved EFSA’s 2014 accounts and granted discharge, citing reasonable assurance from the Court of Auditors on the legality and regularity of transactions.",

While the Court of Auditors affirmed the reliability of accounts and legality of transactions, it highlighted delays in fee collection and payments to national authorities, urging the EMA to streamline processes. Budget execution rates stood at 94.32% (commitments) and 82.30% (payments), both declining from 2013, with €16.05 million in cancelled appropriations. The EMA concluded a €15 million framework contract for management consultancy services, criticized for vague objectives and lack of prior consultation with its Management Board. Staffing saw 580 of 599 posts filled, with 79% of resources allocated to operational tasks. The Parliament welcomed EMA’s revised conflict-of-interest policies, proactive clinical trial data transparency, and adoption of an anti-fraud strategy, but expressed concern over pharmacovigilance weaknesses and an unauthorized adaptive licensing pilot. It called for stricter procurement controls, improved internal management of ICT risks, and enhanced safeguards for whistleblowers. Despite these issues, the Court confirmed the legality of transactions, and the Parliament recommended granting discharge for the 2014 budget.",

It acknowledged the Court of Auditors’ assurance on the reliability of accounts and legality of transactions but highlighted issues such as a high carry-over rate of €1,287,094 (15% of the budget), particularly in administrative expenditure (59% for Title II), attributed to CEPOL’s relocation to Hungary and delayed invoices. While budget implementation improved to 97.40%, payment execution dropped to 82.40%. A 15% cancellation rate for 2013 carry-overs, mainly from the scrapped Matrix project and underestimated grant costs, prompted calls for better project analysis and grant cost accuracy. The Parliament recognized CEPOL’s efforts to reduce carry-overs through improved monitoring but urged further reductions. It criticized recruitment transparency gaps despite adopted guidelines and demanded publication of these rules, alongside enhanced procurement checks to prevent conflicts of interest. Relocation costs (€1,006,515) were partly offset by savings from Hungary’s lower staff correction coefficient, with the remainder split between the Commission and the UK. Outsourcing accounting to the Commission in 2014 was noted as cost-effective. The resolution stressed the need for whistleblowing rules, conflict-of-interest policies, and full disclosure of Governing Board members’ financial interests, while welcoming CEPOL’s 2014 conflict-of-interest policy and partial publication of declarations.

It granted discharge to the Agency’s Executive Director and approved the closure of its 2013 accounts, noting a final budget of €61,345,072 entirely funded by the EU. While the Court of Auditors affirmed the reliability and legality of the accounts, the Parliament highlighted critical issues, including incomplete valuation of key IT systems (SIS II, VIS, and EURODAC), which excluded software development costs, and delays in establishing the Agency’s accounting system, impacting payment planning. Budget implementation rates were 96% for commitments and 67% for payments, with carry-overs attributed to multi-annual contracts. The Parliament expressed deep concern over the Agency’s failure to address conflict-of-interest policies and urged publication of CVs and declarations of interest for senior staff by December 2015. It criticized fragmented operations across Tallinn, Strasbourg, and Austria, recommending centralization to cut costs, and called for finalizing a headquarters agreement with Estonia to clarify operational conditions. Additionally, the Agency was urged to resolve contributions from Schengen-associated countries and improve internal controls, including insurance coverage for assets and mitigation of risks identified in audits.",

Despite recoveries increasing to €4.7 million in 2013 (from €1.3 million in 2012), systemic weaknesses persisted, including failures to recover interest on pre-financing above €750,000 and incomplete IT systems for tracking smaller pre-financing. The resolution urged stricter controls, particularly for budget support (€718 million disbursed in 2013), emphasizing corruption risks and the need for binding performance indicators, parliamentary oversight, and anti-corruption measures in partner countries. It criticized the lack of traceability of EU funds in pooled budgets and called for integrating the EDF into the EU budget to enhance transparency and democratic scrutiny. The 11th EDF’s €27 billion allocation (2011 prices) was noted, reflecting frozen funding levels despite calls for increases.

Geographical and gender imbalances in staffing, particularly in AD grades and leadership roles, alongside overreliance on seconded national experts, were noted as unresolved issues. The resolution urged cost-saving measures through enhanced EU Member State cooperation in foreign policy, co-location of EU delegations with national diplomatic services, shared administrative services, and exploring consular services via EU delegations, pending financial and legislative analysis. It criticized administrative burdens on delegation heads due to financial regulations, dual budget lines complicating expenditures, and delays in establishing a Shared Services Centre to centralize support for CSDP missions and procurement. Concerns were raised about staffing shortages in political sections and operational planning for missions, insufficient integration of external policy dimensions into internal EU policies, and the need for thematic divisions (e.g., conflict prevention, human rights) to be involved in programming from inception. The Parliament reiterated calls to integrate EU Special Representatives into the EEAS for budgetary efficiency and policy coherence and to reduce travel costs through videoconferencing for training and recruitment.",

The Agency’s final 2013 budget was €93.95 million, a 4.88% increase from 2012, with €85.5 million contributed by the EU (1.79% increase). The Court of Auditors found the accounts reliable but could not verify the legality and regularity of all transactions, particularly grants for joint operations, due to insufficient documentation and ex-post controls. Despite corrective actions, three 2012 audit remarks remained unresolved, and new issues emerged, including recruitment procedural shortcomings and inadequate conflict-of-interest policies, with the Agency lacking published CVs or declarations of interest for its Management Board and staff. The Parliament noted a 97.75% budget implementation rate but expressed concern over €32 million (35% of commitments) carried over to 2014, urging improved budget monitoring. It acknowledged reduced budgetary transfers (€12.2 million, down 30% from 2012) and a reinforced ex-ante verification system for post-June 2013 grants but demanded reports on the system’s effectiveness. Additional concerns included delayed reconciliation of supplier accounts, incomplete internal audit follow-ups, and the absence of a headquarters agreement with the host member state since 2005, despite ongoing negotiations. The resolution stressed the need for sound financial management, transparency, and adherence to budgetary annuality, urging Frontex to address these systemic weaknesses promptly.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the approval of the European Aviation Safety Agency’s (EASA) 2013 budget implementation, granting discharge to its Executive Director following the Court of Auditors’ confirmation of reliable accounts and lawful transactions. The Agency’s 2013 budget totaled €167 million (a 5.15% increase from 2012), with €35.8 million from the EU (0.2% rise) and €116.3 million from fees and other sources, achieving a 98% implementation rate. While carry-overs decreased to €7.2 million (8% of the budget), operational expenditure (Title III) retained a high 42% carry-over, partly justified by multiannual projects. Concerns were raised over transparency in outsourcing €22 million of certification activities and low-value contracts, urging clearer documentation. The Agency improved conflict-of-interest management by publishing CVs and declarations of interests for senior staff online. Parliament criticized the 14-year delay in finalizing a headquarters agreement with the host member state (Germany), essential for legal clarity, and urged swift resolution, citing the 2011 precedent of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. It stressed the need for enhanced resources if EASA’s role expands under Single European Sky reforms and called for differentiated staffing rules to exempt industry-funded personnel from EU budget cuts. Internal audits noted progress, with 22 of 23 prior recommendations addressed, but flagged two critical IT management issues. The resolution also emphasized compliance with budgetary annuality and urged revising EASA’s code of conduct to prevent conflicts of interest.",

While acknowledging improvements in reducing carry-overs (from 23% in 2008 to 11% in 2013) and high operational execution (96.99% under Title III), it urged stricter budget monitoring. The resolution highlighted deficiencies in conflict-of-interest management, criticizing EFSA’s reliance on panel-specific mandates rather than its broader remit, anonymized declarations, and exemptions for experts from industry-linked organizations. It demanded a two-year cooling-off period for experts transitioning to the agri-food sector and compliance with the European Ombudsman’s ruling to revise transparency rules, particularly for academic financial disclosures. Internal control weaknesses were flagged, including unmet standards on staff appraisal and document management, delayed implementation of critical audit recommendations (notably on information security), and insufficient procurement details in annual plans. The Parliament commended EFSA’s environmental initiatives and scientific focus (74% of resources allocated to scientific activities) but criticized non-transparent Management Board elections and unclear communication about EU budget funding. It urged cost reductions for transport services (€918,668 in 2013) and highlighted staffing gaps (328 of 351 posts filled). Despite these issues, the resolution approved the 2013 accounts closure, citing the Court of Auditors’ assurance of their reliability and legality, and recommended granting discharge to EFSA’s Executive Director.",

Emphasizing EIGE’s role as the EU’s gender equality knowledge center, the Parliament urged closer collaboration with Eurostat and the Fundamental Rights Agency to produce sex-disaggregated data, particularly on gender-based violence and female employment. It called for enhanced interaction with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, including integrating joint meetings into EIGE’s annual work programme and proactively sharing research outcomes to inform policy. The resolution stressed the need for improved budget efficiency, transparency, and risk management, while reaffirming EIGE’s mandate to promote gender mainstreaming and combat discrimination across EU policies.",

It highlighted a €500,000 carry-over for the Agency’s new Athens office, part of €1.2 million in total carry-overs, with €800,000 under Title II (59% of Title II appropriations) linked to office relocation costs. While acknowledging the Court of Auditors’ assurance on the reliability of accounts and legality of transactions, Parliament urged ENISA to address fragmented staff locations (administrative staff in Heraklion, operational staff in Athens) to reduce administrative costs. It noted delays in rent payments by Greek authorities for the Athens office, posing financial and continuity risks, though penalties were avoided. Parliament called for updates on resolving these delays and on measures to ensure workspace cost-effectiveness and environmental compliance, which ENISA had not addressed. Internal controls were deemed improved, with an Internal Control Coordinator addressing audit recommendations, though one \"Very Important\" recommendation on ex-post controls remained pending validation. Transparency efforts, including publishing declarations of interest and CVs of senior staff, were acknowledged. The resolution approved the closure of ENISA’s 2013 accounts and emphasized compliance with financial regulations and audit follow-ups.",

Budget execution reached 99.68%, with payment appropriations at 88.97%, while carryovers decreased to 10.71% (from 16.21% in 2015), reflecting stricter monitoring. Recruitment challenges persisted, with 95.7% of posts filled amid high turnover and housing costs in Frankfurt affecting staffing; gender balance was achieved (53% female staff). The Authority implemented e-procurement, open-office reforms, and wellness initiatives, though sick leave averaged seven days per employee. Transparency efforts included publishing meeting minutes, whistleblowing policies, and declarations of interest (with some delays), while six document access requests were mostly granted. Internal audits found no critical issues, and environmental measures reduced CO2 emissions. The resolution highlighted EIOPA’s role in financial stability, supervisory convergence, and consumer protection, stressing adherence to its mandate amid Brexit-related uncertainties, including potential revenue declines and operational impacts. It called for enhanced transparency through quicker publication of meeting records and safeguards for whistleblowers, while urging resource optimization to balance regulatory and supervisory tasks without overstepping its remit.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns and outlined key decisions regarding the European Union Agency for Railways’ 2016 operations, approving the closure of its 2016 accounts with a final budget of €27.5 million (a 4.56% increase from 2015) and acknowledging the Court of Auditors’ assurance on the reliability of accounts and legality of transactions. It highlighted a 99.2% budget implementation rate and 91.57% payment execution rate, while urging the Agency to address delays in invoice processing to meet a 95% payment deadline target. The resolution criticized the Agency’s dual-seat arrangement (Lille/Valenciennes) as costly and inefficient, calling on the Council to centralize operations. Staffing issues included a gender imbalance (62% male, 38% female), particularly in senior roles, and a reduction in administrative staff despite Commission-mandated cuts. The Agency was commended for operational achievements, including ISO 9001 certification, improved fraud prevention measures, and a focus on rail safety and interoperability, notably through the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). Concerns were raised about budgetary constraints conflicting with expanded responsibilities under the 2016 Agency Regulation, which grants fee-charging authority and transforms the Agency into a central authorizing body by 2019. The resolution also emphasized the need for enhanced whistleblower protections, transparency in conflicts of interest declarations, and alignment of human resources with strategic goals, while noting low sick leave (3.2 days average) and no reported harassment cases in 2016.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns and outlined key actions regarding EU agencies’ governance, financial management, and operational effectiveness. It emphasized agencies’ critical role in policy areas like health, security, justice, and economic affairs, impacting citizens directly, while noting limited public visibility despite their influence. The 2016 combined agency budget totaled €3.4 billion (a 21.42% increase from 2015), with €2.4 billion from the EU budget and €1 billion from fees and member state contributions. Staffing rose by 5.24% to 10,364 employees, driven by new tasks in sectors like justice, home affairs, and industry. The Court of Auditors issued unqualified opinions for all agencies except the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), which faced procurement irregularities. Parliament urged streamlined discharge procedures, advocating deadlines for financial reporting by 31 March and Court audits by 1 July to accelerate accountability. It highlighted challenges in budget execution, including excessive carry-overs (noted in 23 agencies) and procurement non-compliance by EASO, EMCDDA, and others, while acknowledging progress in shared services, such as joint procurements saving €10.7 million. Concerns were raised about staff reductions (5% target 2013–2018, with 279 posts cut by 2017) and Brexit’s impact on agencies like EMA and EBA, urging contingency plans. Parliament called for enhanced transparency, including whistleblower protections (only 71% of agencies had guidelines), conflict-of-interest management, and standardized public access to documents. It stressed the need for IT harmonization, performance-based budgeting, and inter-agency cooperation, while criticizing horizontal staff cuts for hindering mandates and urging tailored solutions. The resolution also urged revising financial regulations to reduce audit burdens and address gaps in external evaluations for agencies like BEREC and eu-LISA.",

While acknowledging the Court of Auditors’ assurance on the reliability of accounts and legality of transactions, Parliament criticized the Centre’s lack of a business continuity plan, urging immediate action. It highlighted a decrease in cash reserves to €34.2 million and reserves to €31.1 million, linked to efforts to reduce accumulated surpluses through revised pricing. Staffing concerns included a persistent gender imbalance (61.64% female to 38.36% male) and adherence to a 5% staff reduction target since 2014, though Parliament advised against further cuts to ensure quality services. Operational achievements included signing three new client agreements (totaling 64 clients), adopting a quality assurance action plan (98.2% implemented), and advancing language technologies like the IATE database. Parliament urged EU agencies to avoid duplicating translation services and called for improved transparency, including publishing management board minutes. It endorsed the Centre’s anti-fraud measures, whistleblowing protocols, and quality enforcement against substandard external translations, while stressing the need for performance indicators and systematic evaluations. Concerns were raised about risks to the Centre’s business model due to agencies increasingly using in-house translation solutions, potentially undermining its financial sustainability.",

It highlighted the Committee’s reduction of permanent staff from 537 to 489 posts (2013–2017) alongside increased reliance on temporary and contract staff (54 contract staff in 2017, up from 34 in 2013), partly due to security needs, while urging workload distribution assessments. The resolution emphasized performance-based budgeting, urging closer alignment of payment and commitment rates, particularly for building-related expenditures (77.1% payment execution rate). It criticized incomplete follow-up to prior discharge recommendations and called for improved transparency in reporting events (€8.88 million spent on member travel) and publications (9 in 2017 vs. a 15-target). Gender balance concerns were noted, with women occupying only 25% of senior management roles (down from 33% in 2016) and 38% of middle management, alongside calls to improve geographical representation (13.3% of management from post-2004 EU states). The Committee was commended for citizen engagement initiatives (180 dialogues under \"Reflecting on Europe\") and environmental measures (Good Food Label), while translation inefficiencies (€27.2 million total cost, 17.1% outsourcing) and unresolved whistleblower disputes (including a €5,000 court-ordered compensation) were flagged.

It welcomed the final €312 million settlement for the Europa building and €4.67 million land acquisitions, alongside environmental efforts under EMAS and ISO 14001. However, Parliament condemned the Council’s persistent lack of cooperation, including refusal to join the Transparency Register, failure to answer written questions, and non-attendance at discharge hearings, recalling past discharge denials (2009-2016).

It highlighted the Court of Auditors’ finding of no material errors in payments and no significant weaknesses in human resources or procurement.

It praised cost-saving measures, including an 11% reduction in translation expenses (€263,000 in 2017) and efforts to enhance transparency, such as website accessibility improvements and the inaugural ‘Award for Good Administration’. Concerns were raised over staffing shifts, including a 5% reduction in permanent staff (2013–2017) offset by rising contractual staff (8 to 15) and trainees (5 to 9), potentially straining workload distribution. Gender balance achievements (50% female middle managers) and work-life balance initiatives (58 of 83 staff teleworking) were commended, alongside harassment prevention policies and ethical guidelines addressing revolving doors.

It highlighted unplanned carryovers of €200,000 for office reorganization and cancellations of €194,467.98 (4.93% of 2016 carryovers), urging differentiated budget appropriations to address recurring high carryovers (40% for Titles II and III). The Agency’s performance was largely praised, including its support for SMEs through OSH tools, completion of the \"Healthy Workplaces for All Ages\" project, and multilingual initiatives that earned a European Ombudsman Award. However, web communication and work program delivery fell slightly short of targets. Staffing saw 39 temporary agents (97.5% filled) and 24 contract agents, with one concluded harassment case prompting calls for improved safeguards. Procurement concerns included delayed e-procurement adoption and a problematic IT framework contract. The Parliament urged stronger independence for the accounting officer, potentially outsourcing the role to DG BUDG, and noted Brexit impact analyses. It welcomed whistleblowing policies and collaboration with other agencies like Eurofound and Cedefop, while approving the 2017 accounts and granting discharge, acknowledging the Court of Auditors’ assurance of legality and regularity in transactions.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns and outlined key decisions regarding the European Aviation Safety Agency’s (EASA) 2017 budget implementation, noting its final budget of €191.6 million (a 0.92% decrease from 2016), with €34.87 million from the EU budget and €101.4 million from fees. While acknowledging a 99% budget implementation rate and improved payment execution (93.75%, up 2.55% from 2016), it highlighted an accumulated €52 million surplus from industry-funded certification activities, urging corrective measures to align with regulations requiring fees to cover costs without surpluses. The Agency committed to revising its Financial and Fees Regulations by 2020 to address this. Parliament noted EASA’s initiatives, including the European Strategic Coordination Platform, the Cybersecurity in Aviation center, and Data4Safety projects (€11.3 million in 2017), alongside agreements with France, Germany, and Italy on civil-military aviation cooperation. It emphasized new mandates under Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, including drone regulation, and urged adequate resources for expanded responsibilities in conflict zone risks, environmental issues, and unmanned aircraft. Gender imbalance in senior management (5/5 male executives, 25/29 male board members) was criticized, with calls for improved balance. Procurement concerns included a €22 million IT framework contract lacking competitive procedures, prompting commitments to enhance competition. Transparency measures, such as publishing staff meetings with stakeholders, and efforts to prevent conflicts of interest (revised policies, whistleblowing guidelines) were welcomed. The Agency’s internal audits showed effective risk mitigation, and its 2017 staffing included 673 temporary agents (100% establishment plan execution) and 80 contract agents. Parliament also noted EASA’s high global audit ranking and urged continued engagement in Horizon 2020 research.",

The resolution noted ESMA’s 2014 budget of €33.27 million, an 18.02% increase from 2013 due to expanded responsibilities, and acknowledged the Court of Auditors’ assurance that ESMA’s accounts were reliable and transactions legal. However, it criticized ESMA for non-compliant procurement practices, including €956,000 spent via a French purchasing body (UGAP) in violation of financial rules, though corrective measures were implemented. Budget execution improved to 98.89%, with a 81.16% payment rate, while carryovers for operational expenses decreased to 45%. Staffing rose to 167 (55% male, 45% female), with efforts toward geographical balance. The resolution emphasized ESMA’s technical role in financial stability and consumer protection, stressing the need to avoid overstepping its mandate and to improve transparency, including disclosing stakeholder meetings and sharing detailed methodologies with Parliament. It flagged inadequate financing reliant on national contributions, urging a Union-funded model via market fees by 2017. Other measures included reducing late payments to below 1% by 2015, adopting anti-fraud strategies (2015–2017), and resolving VAT reimbursement issues. The Parliament reiterated demands for timely, equal information sharing with legislators and adherence to proportionality in regulatory design, particularly for smaller entities.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns and outlined key actions regarding EU agencies’ governance, financial management, transparency, and performance, noting the 2014 budget totaled €1.9 billion (5% less than 2013), with 63% from EU funding and the rest from fees. Agencies employed 6,578 permanent/temporary staff (a 0.64% increase) and 3,200 contract/seconded personnel, with growth concentrated in agencies handling financial supervision and Horizon 2020 tasks. It acknowledged progress under the 2012 Common Approach, with 99% of agency-specific roadmap actions completed, and welcomed Commission guidelines on performance indicators and staff rules. Financial challenges included carry-overs affecting 28 agencies, partly justified by multiannual programs, and €550,000 in added audit costs due to privatized audits, which increased administrative burdens by 85%. The resolution urged agencies to reduce unjustified carry-overs, enhance gender balance in leadership, adopt anti-fraud strategies (80% already in place), and publish CVs/conflict-of-interest declarations (74% compliance). It demanded stricter whistleblower protections, merging of smaller agencies for efficiency, and improved communication via multilingual websites and social media. Concerns included staffing cuts hindering mandates, dual agency seats without operational value, and conflicts of interest from industry-funded staff. The Parliament called for aligning budgets with EU 2020 Strategy goals, transparency in lobbying, and safeguarding independence, particularly for fee-funded agencies. It stressed performance audits, collaboration among agencies, and finalizing headquarters agreements with host states to ensure operational stability.",

The Agency’s 2016 budget was €15,872,582, a 40.89% increase from 2015, driven by expanded mandates, including completing the internal energy market. Budget implementation reached 98.11%, but payment execution dropped to 59.95%, reflecting delays. High carry-overs for operational expenditure (86%, €4.9 million) were noted, linked to long-term regulatory tasks under Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011, though the Agency attributed this to contractual cycles and achieved 100% commitment for REMIT-related funds. Staffing included 112 employees (38% female, 62% male), with 15 new temporary agents added. Work-life balance initiatives and anti-harassment policies were acknowledged, alongside transparency measures like publishing conflicts of interest and introducing a register for the Director’s external meetings. Internal controls met standards, but improvements in IT governance and procurement planning were urged following an audit identifying inefficiencies. The Agency’s achievements included advancing energy market integration and REMIT implementation, though systematic performance evaluations were lacking. Parliament approved the 2016 accounts closure but stressed addressing carry-over management, gender balance, and delayed establishment of a European School in Slovenia per a 2014 agreement.",

It emphasized the Joint Undertaking’s funding structure, with planned contributions of €1.185 billion from the EU, €1.17 billion from Participating States, and €1.658 billion from private members under Horizon 2020. However, concerns were raised over low Participating States’ payments (€56.8 million, 4.9% of required contributions) and delays in recognizing costs, urging improved reporting. Private members’ in-kind contributions reached €202 million against the EU’s €264 million cash input. The Court of Auditors issued a qualified opinion on €118 million (54% of 2016 operational payments) linked to legacy projects from predecessor entities (ARTEMIS and ENIAC), citing unresolved audit risks. Financial irregularities included a €230,000 loss from unrecovered pre-financing to insolvent beneficiaries, attributed to delayed action. Governance weaknesses included inconsistent conflict-of-interest management and an outdated internal register. Staffing stood at 29, with structural adjustments to align with priorities. The resolution stressed the need for enhanced communication on research outcomes and urged the Joint Undertaking’s involvement in Horizon 2020 mid-term simplifications.",

It noted the CJEU’s prudent financial management, with a 98.2% implementation rate of its €380 million budget, though flagged a slight decrease compared to previous years and a €1.62 million revenue shortfall due to delayed appointments of General Court judges. The resolution welcomed the CJEU’s adoption of performance-based budgeting and urged further integration of this approach. It emphasized the need to streamline the discharge process, proposing deadlines to align with private-sector efficiency, and criticized persistent overestimations in mission budgets (€342,000 committed vs. €157,974 spent). Judicial reforms, including doubling General Court judges by 2019, were acknowledged, alongside concerns over case duration (average 16.7 months in 2016) and the impact of 14 weeks of judicial vacations. The CJEU’s 2016 caseload included 1,604 new cases and 1,628 completed cases, with rising intellectual property disputes. Transparency measures were demanded, including public disclosure of judges’ external activities, CVs, and declarations of interest, alongside stricter \"revolving door\" rules. Gender imbalance in judicial appointments (5 female CJEU judges, 10 in the General Court) and high staff turnover were flagged, alongside calls to remunerate all trainees (245 traineeships, 188 unpaid). IT advancements like the \"e-Curia\" platform (3,599 users in 2016) and environmental targets were praised, while whistleblower protections (2016 guidelines) and cost concerns over short-term judicial appointments (€69,498 for a 4-month mandate) were highlighted.

It emphasized streamlining the discharge process by proposing deadlines of 31 March for annual activity reports and 1 July for the Court’s report to reduce the 17-month procedural gap, aiming for a November plenary vote. The EESC’s 2016 budget totaled €130.6 million (97.55% utilized), with €19.56 million allocated to members’ travel and subsistence, while urging cost-benefit assessments of missions and environmental savings. Parliament supported performance-based budgeting, modernization efforts requiring transparency, and cooperation with the Committee of the Regions (shared translation/logistics), but flagged concerns over 9/22 non-competitive tenders, increased translation outsourcing (16.61% due to staff cuts), and a 43-post reduction (8%) impacting gender/geographic balance. It noted a 30% media coverage rise, reduced resource consumption under EMAS, and shortcomings in conflict-of-interest guidelines and leadership declarations of interest, demanding standardized publication by June 2018. Harassment cases (costing €55,772) and Brexit’s uncertain impact necessitated staff well-being measures, improved whistleblower protections, and impact assessments by end-2018.",

It acknowledged the Court of Auditors’ assurance of reliable accounts and legal transactions but highlighted high carry-over rates: 30% (€417,279) for administrative expenditures (Title II), mainly due to incomplete IT services, and 43% (€3,370,616) for operational activities (Title III), linked to multi-annual projects. The Agency was urged to consider differentiated budget appropriations to address these issues. Procurement totaled €8,492,938.92, with concerns over IT consultancy contracts (€400,000 in 2016) lacking fixed deliverables, though the Agency adopted corrective measures. Staff policy noted 39 occupied posts (of 41 authorized), a gender imbalance (72% female), and work-life initiatives (€194 per staff for well-being). The Agency lacked internal whistleblowing rules but had an anti-fraud strategy and no conflict-of-interest cases. Achievements included tools for small enterprises and inter-agency collaboration. The revised founding regulation now mandates external evaluations.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over the European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems’ 2016 budget implementation, granting discharge but highlighting irregularities. The Agency’s 2016 budget was €82.3 million (a 21.77% increase from 2015), primarily for IT systems like the Visa Information System (VIS) and Biometrics Matching System (BMS). The Court of Auditors confirmed reliable accounts but noted issues, including unauthorized acceptance of €2.8 million in supplies without prior budgetary or contractual commitments, later regularized retroactively. Budget execution rates were 97.9% (commitments) and 97.6% (payments), with high administrative carry-overs (€5 million, 63% of Title II commitments) linked to building maintenance and consultancy. A €21.5 million construction contract for Strasbourg premises saw full payment by 2016 despite only half completion, raising concerns over advance payments. Procurement flaws included a €194 million framework contract for VIS/BMS development, which risked limited competition due to proprietary technology requirements. Staffing challenges included understaffing (114 of 118 posts filled), over-reliance on external personnel, and severe gender imbalances (28% female staff; 11% female management board members). Internal audits identified weaknesses in IT project management and HR processes, though the Agency maintained stable operations of critical systems (SIS II, Eurodac) and supported new EU initiatives. Anti-fraud strategy implementation improved from 60% to 80%, but whistleblowing rules remained pending. The Parliament urged corrective actions on procurement compliance, gender balance, and audit recommendations, while acknowledging achievements in IT system management and inter-agency cooperation.",

Budget execution reached 99%, with 91% payment execution, while relocation to new premises cost €12.4 million (partly financed by the EU’s €3 million contribution). Staffing saw full occupancy of 676 posts, but gender imbalance persisted (34% female, 66% male), particularly in senior management. Procurement involved 40 procedures over €60,000 and 400 framework contracts, with improved planning measures. Internal audits found no critical issues, and anti-fraud measures, including staff training and whistleblowing rules, were implemented. The resolution stressed the need for adequate funding and staffing to address Brexit’s potential revenue impact (70% of fees at risk) and expanded responsibilities under revised regulations, including drone safety and conflict zone risks.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised key points regarding the European Banking Authority’s (EBA) 2016 operations, noting its final budget of €36,491,378 (a 9.19% increase from 2015), funded 40% by the EU and 60% by national authorities. The Court of Auditors confirmed the reliability of accounts and legality of transactions, with a 96.76% budget implementation rate (down 2.58% from 2015) and 88.67% payment execution. Carryovers decreased to 8% (the lowest ever), while 34 budgetary transfers remained within limits. Procurement efficiency was highlighted, with only 0.9% of invoices paid late and no late payment interest for three consecutive years. Staffing reached 126 posts (50.3% female), though Management Board gender diversity was criticized. The EBA addressed 17 conflict-of-interest cases (shareholdings and prior employment), enforced transparency via published declarations, and maintained anti-fraud measures, including a whistleblowing policy. Brexit-related risks included a €14 million contingent liability for lease termination and potential relocation costs, mitigated by a negotiated lease break clause requiring repayment of half a €3.2 million incentive. The resolution stressed the EBA’s critical role in financial stability, supervisory convergence, and consumer protection, urging resource reallocation to prioritize enforcement tasks while ensuring independence and transparency. Environmental efforts and business continuity during relocation were acknowledged, with calls for regular reporting on costs and operational impacts.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns and outlined key decisions regarding the European Chemicals Agency’s (ECHA) 2016 operations, approving the closure of its accounts and granting discharge to its Executive Director. The Agency’s 2016 budget was €110.8 million, a 7.82% decrease from 2015, with €60.9 million in EU subsidies reflecting increased responsibilities under REACH, Biocidal Products, and Prior Informed Consent (PIC) regulations. Fee income covered 46% of expenditures, including €7.6 million from biocides and €33.4 million from REACH, though Parliament urged safeguards to ensure independence from industry influence. Carry-overs for REACH and biocides operational expenditures were high (€10.1 million, 39%, and €1.3 million, 68%, respectively), attributed to multi-annual IT projects and substance evaluation contracts, prompting calls for differentiated budget appropriations. Staffing achieved 98% recruitment targets, with 455 temporary posts filled and gender balance (53% female), though concerns were noted over low staff well-being engagement. Transparency improvements included a redesigned public portal and consumer microsite, alongside anti-fraud measures like mandatory conflict-of-interest training. Parliament highlighted risks from Brexit, including potential fee reductions, regulatory workload shifts, and IT adjustments, urging proactive planning. Environmental efforts included CO2 reduction initiatives, while collaboration with the European Food Safety Authority on endocrine disruptors and a Commission-mandated external performance evaluation were noted. The Court of Auditors affirmed the legality and reliability of accounts but stressed the need for better budgetary alignment with multi-annual operations.",

Staff reductions (2%, 7 posts) left 450 of 470 posts occupied, with 74% dedicated to operational activities (below the 75% target) and significant gender imbalances in senior roles (68% male). EFSA adopted a new independence policy introducing conflict-of-interest rules, cooling-off periods, and restrictions on financial interests, but Parliament criticized its narrow scope, exclusion of research funding disclosures, and non-compliance with the European Ombudsman’s recommendations on academic conflicts. The Court of Auditors affirmed reliable accounts but flagged gaps in IT governance and internal controls, urging a comprehensive financial ex-post control strategy. EFSA achieved key milestones, including Strategy 2020, transparency initiatives (TERA project, open data tools, and the \"Knowledge Junction\" repository), and collaborations with EU agencies, producing 481 scientific outputs and closing 382 questions, though timeliness issues persisted. Parliament highlighted Brexit-related risks to resources, contracts, and operational continuity, alongside concerns over partial document access in the glyphosate case, which prompted litigation by MEPs. While EFSA improved eco-management (ISO 14001 certification, EMAS registration) and staff well-being, Parliament urged stricter gender balance in senior roles, enhanced independence safeguards, and sufficient resources for EFSA and the European Chemicals Agency to fulfill risk-assessment mandates. Calls were made for stakeholder dialogue to review EU risk-assessment legislation and ensure transparency in scientific decision-making.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about systemic misuse of EU funds through oligarchic structures, corruption, and conflicts of interest, particularly in cohesion and agricultural policies, exacerbated by weak oversight and control mechanisms. It highlighted the €1.8 trillion MFF 2021-2027 and Recovery and Resilience Facility, stressing the need for rigorous adherence to rule of law, transparency, and anti-fraud measures. Specific issues included Hungary’s 10% financial correction (€1.2 billion) due to public procurement flaws, Czechia’s Agrofert case where 75% of agricultural funds went to large entities linked to former PM Andrej Babiš, and skewed CAP distributions where 0.5% of beneficiaries received 16.6% of payments (over €100,000 each) versus 75% receiving under €5,000. The resolution urged capping payments per beneficiary (e.g., €500,000 for CAP first pillar, €1 million for second pillar) and mandatory use of anti-fraud tools like Arachne and EDES, noting low OLAF indictment (37%) and recovery rates (21%). It criticized delays in applying the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation to Hungary and Poland and called for EPPO expansion, citing five non-participating states. Public procurement deficiencies were flagged, including single-bidder contracts (50% in Czechia, Poland) and irregularities in Bulgaria, Romania, and Cyprus. The Parliament demanded stricter NGO oversight to prevent misuse, enhanced transparency on beneficial ownership, and support for investigative journalism. Reforms to the Financial Regulation, including harmonized data systems and strengthened conflict-of-interest rules, were emphasized to combat oligarchic capture and ensure equitable fund distribution.",

While the Court of Auditors issued unqualified opinions on most agencies’ accounts, qualified opinions were given for ACER and EASO due to payment irregularities, and 82 procurement-related weaknesses were identified across 29 agencies. Parliament highlighted persistent gender imbalances, with only three agencies achieving even gender balance in senior management and 16 agencies lacking balance, urging alignment with the Commission’s 50% gender parity target by 2024. Staffing challenges included underrepresentation of eight Member States, high sick leave (8.42 days average), and recruitment difficulties, exacerbated by rigid procedures and underfunding for new tasks. Agencies were urged to enhance performance measurement through improved key performance indicators (KPIs), adopt sustainability reporting, and strengthen cybersecurity. Parliament called for stricter conflict-of-interest rules, transparency in stakeholder interactions, and compliance with whistleblower protections. It emphasized the need for agencies to avoid mission overlaps, optimize resources, and increase public visibility, while supporting flexible governance models and inter-agency cooperation to address crises and societal challenges effectively.",
