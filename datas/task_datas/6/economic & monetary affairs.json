It noted the ECB’s monetary policy actions, including two interest rate hikes (25 basis points each in April and August 2011) followed by two reductions (25 basis points each in November and December 2011), and the launch of three-year Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) totaling over €1 trillion (€489.2 billion in December 2011 and €529.5 billion in February 2012) to stabilize financial markets. Despite these efforts, credit growth to the private sector slowed sharply (from 1.6% in 2010 to 0.4% in 2011), inflation rose to 2.7% (driven by energy prices), and government debt increased to 88% of GDP. The resolution acknowledged the ECB’s Securities Markets Programme (SMP), which temporarily reduced borrowing costs for struggling states, but criticized structural shortcomings, including risks from transferring sovereign and bank liabilities to the ECB’s balance sheet (now over 30% of eurozone GDP) and excessive reliance on non-marketable collateral (23% of total). It urged greater transparency, including publication of collateral details, voting records, and SMP bond purchase prices, and called for conditional lending to boost SME credit, which employs 72% of the workforce. The Parliament stressed the urgency of a banking union with a single supervisory mechanism (SSM), resolution authority, and deposit guarantees, while safeguarding against conflicts between monetary and supervisory roles. It criticized the ECB’s lack of gender parity in leadership and insufficient accountability of the Troika, demanding enhanced parliamentary oversight. Finally, the resolution emphasized the need for growth-oriented policies, fiscal consolidation, and Treaty revisions to address institutional gaps and reinforce democratic accountability in ECB operations.",

The resolution welcomed the BoP proposal as a step toward parity between euro and non-euro states, acknowledging challenges due to existing euro-area mechanisms like the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which has a €500 billion lending capacity and potential direct bank recapitalization. It stressed the need for democratic accountability and alignment with national parliamentary functions, while advocating for updated Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 to streamline BoP activation. The Parliament endorsed Article 352 TFEU as the legal basis for new financial assistance frameworks beyond Article 143 TFEU but criticized the omission of subsidiarity and proportionality principles under Article 5 of Protocol No 2, urging the Commission and Council to explicitly address these before finalizing the regulation. Additionally, it highlighted the BoP’s potential to enhance administrative capacity for absorbing EU funds and called for equitable treatment of all Member States in financial support mechanisms.",

It advocated voluntary cross-border DGS or linkages between national schemes to enhance the internal market, with supervision by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in cooperation with national authorities. The resolution stressed the importance of aligning DGS operational areas with the economic costs of bank failures, ensuring balanced and stable cross-border schemes, and facilitating depositor access to foreign credit institution branches. It highlighted cooperation between national DGS to streamline depositor interactions and enable voluntary cross-border credit provision. By standardizing key elements like coverage, reimbursement timelines, and fund usage terms, the resolution aimed to achieve depositor protection, financial system stability, and equitable competition, while allowing member states flexibility to tailor schemes to national contexts.",

It called for a reformed VAT system based on the destination principle (taxation at the place of consumption), enhanced cross-border cooperation, and the implementation of one-stop-shop mechanisms by 2015 to simplify compliance. The resolution emphasized harmonizing VAT rates for digital and physical goods (e.g., aligning e-books with printed books), cultural items, and cross-border transport services to eliminate distortions, while advocating reduced rates for eco-friendly products under a Green VAT strategy. It highlighted SMEs (99% of EU businesses) and proposed a pan-EU VAT exemption threshold to reduce administrative burdens, alongside digital solutions like standardized e-invoicing and mutual recognition of e-identification. The Parliament urged Member States to adopt a binding list of goods/services eligible for reduced rates by 2013, improve anti-fraud tools (e.g., reverse charge mechanisms in high-risk sectors, strengthened EUROFISC and VIES systems), and enhance judicial cooperation via Europol and Eurojust. It also addressed transport sector disparities, advocating harmonized VAT for intra-EU travel and taxing services at the place of departure, while supporting reduced rates for public transport on social and environmental grounds. The resolution underscored the need to balance VAT efficiency with fairness, protect non-profit organizations, and align reforms with the Europe 2020 strategy, urging the Commission to propose simplified cross-border taxation rules by 2012 and consolidate anti-fraud legislation.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised the European Investment Bank’s (EIB) 60-year achievements, including €1.1 trillion invested in 11,800 projects across 160 countries, with over 90% of lending within the EU. It highlighted the EIB’s 2017 record of approving 901 projects, including €78 billion for innovation, environment, infrastructure, and SMEs, and noted that 2015-2016 lending within the EU is projected to support €544 billion in investments, adding 2.3% to GDP and creating 2.25 million jobs by 2020. The resolution emphasized the EIB’s role in countering post-crisis investment gaps, with the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) mobilizing €335 billion since 2015, supporting 750,000 jobs and aiming for 1.4 million by 2020. Environmental efforts were underscored, including €16.6 billion in 2017 for climate-related projects, exceeding its 25% climate financing target, and issuing €500 million in Sustainability Awareness Bonds. The EIB’s support for SMEs and mid-caps totaled €29.6 billion in 2017, benefiting 287,000 firms employing 3.9 million people. Parliament urged reduced dollar-denominated funding (33% in 2017) to mitigate sanctions risks and called for enhanced transparency, accountability, and alignment with EU policies like the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals. It stressed the need for balanced geographical distribution, as 70% of 2017 financing went to six Member States, and supported the Economic Resilience Initiative (€6 billion over five years) for migration-affected regions. Concerns over Brexit included safeguarding the EIB’s AAA rating and equitable solutions for UK staff. The resolution also demanded stricter anti-tax avoidance measures, fossil fuel divestment, and stronger due diligence on intermediaries to prevent fraud and money laundering, while advocating for cross-border projects and deeper cooperation with national promotional banks.",

Unemployment remained alarmingly high at 11.9% in 2013, with youth unemployment exceeding 50% in some states, exacerbating economic divergence. The ECB’s monetary policies, including lowering key interest rates to 0.05% and introducing unconventional measures like targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and asset purchases, were acknowledged for stabilizing financial markets but criticized for failing to spur credit growth, job creation, or inflation, which fell to 0.5% in 2014, far below the 2% target. Private and public investment stagnated at pre-crisis lows, with SMEs facing a 35% lending decline (2008–2013) despite employing 72% of the workforce. Financial fragmentation persisted, with uneven borrowing costs across states, while bank balance sheets remained fragile, highlighted by the ECB’s comprehensive assessment. The resolution stressed the need for structural reforms, growth-friendly fiscal policies, and public investment—such as the proposed €300 billion Juncker plan—to complement ECB actions, warning that prolonged low rates risked distorting markets and undermining savings. It called for enhanced transparency in ECB asset purchases, gender balance in appointments, and a clear separation between monetary policy and banking supervision under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Concerns over deflation risks, unsustainable debt levels (near or above 100% of GDP in many states), and social inequalities linked to austerity were emphasized, alongside calls for labor market reforms that protect workers’ rights and address poverty, which increased by 10 million people (2010–2012). The ECB’s independence and adherence to its price stability mandate were reaffirmed, while its role in the Troika was questioned for overstepping fiscal boundaries. The resolution concluded that monetary policy alone could not resolve structural weaknesses without coordinated fiscal and investment strategies.",

It acknowledged the ECB’s expanded Asset Purchase Programme (APP), which grew to €1.7 trillion by March 2017, including corporate and regional bonds, and noted its role in improving financial conditions and narrowing sovereign bond spreads, though benefits remained uneven across Member States. The resolution highlighted risks from prolonged ultra-low interest rates (0% MRO, -0.40% deposit rate), including reduced bank profitability, distortions in savings and pensions, and potential asset bubbles, while urging careful monitoring and exit planning. It stressed the need for structural reforms, fiscal consolidation (deficit projected to fall from 2.1% in 2015 to 1.6% in 2017), and completion of the banking union to address non-performing loans and financial fragmentation. Concerns were raised about the ECB’s corporate bond purchases potentially distorting markets and the lack of transparency in collateral valuation. The Parliament emphasized the ECB’s mandate to maintain price stability and called for coordinated national policies to complement monetary measures, warning against deferring reforms due to low borrowing costs. It also urged addressing TARGET 2 imbalances, improving macroprudential oversight of shadow banking (€22 trillion in assets), and ensuring proportionality in banking supervision, while supporting ECB transparency efforts and the legal framework governing bond purchases to avoid monetary financing of governments.",

It urged the Commission to promote digital ID interoperability, create EU-wide comparison tools and dispute resolution mechanisms, and ensure non-digital access to essential services to prevent exclusion. Other priorities included harmonizing insurance guarantee schemes, improving financial literacy, restricting risky retail investor products (e.g., bail-in instruments), and fostering fintech growth via regulatory neutrality and innovation-friendly frameworks.

The resolution emphasized enhancing transparency and mitigating risks by mandating reporting of SFTs to trade repositories, requiring ESMA to develop technical standards specifying reporting formats, including global legal entity identifiers (LEIs) and unique transaction identifiers. Central banks of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) were exempt from reporting but required to cooperate with authorities upon request. Credit institutions and listed companies must disclose SFT activities in annual reports to inform investors and shareholders. The resolution aligned with FSB’s 2013 framework and 2014 recommendations on collateral haircuts for non-centrally cleared SFTs, urging ESMA to monitor FSB developments and prepare a report by 2016 to assess quantitative impacts and propose a consistent EU framework. Phased implementation of reporting obligations was introduced, considering counterparties’ operational readiness. ESMA was tasked with publishing annual reports on aggregate SFT volumes and overseeing trade repository registration, with a 40-day review period for applications. The Commission was mandated to evaluate the regulation’s effectiveness within 15 months, propose further measures to address leverage and pro-cyclicality, and report on circumvention risks. Delegated acts were authorized to amend exemptions for third-country central banks based on evidence of necessity, ensuring alignment with supervisory needs.",

The resolution highlighted SMEs, representing 99.8% of EU businesses, as vital to economic recovery but facing financing challenges, and urged targeted support for rural and less-developed regions. It welcomed the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA) to curb monopolistic practices in digital markets, stressing the need for adequate enforcement resources and synergies with antitrust tools. Concerns over foreign subsidies distorting the single market led to calls for robust implementation of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation and enhanced global cooperation, including through the EU-US Trade and Technology Council. The Parliament supported revised State aid guidelines aligned with the European Green Deal, including aid for coal phase-outs and climate-neutral technologies, while cautioning against airline industry consolidation fueled by pandemic-era State aid. It urged modernization of merger control rules to address data concentration, zero-price markets, and \"killer acquisitions,\" emphasizing personal data’s role in digital mergers. Antitrust reforms were advocated to tackle vertical agreements, geo-blocking, and territorial supply constraints, alongside stronger enforcement against anti-competitive practices in agriculture, IoT, and digital advertising. The resolution also stressed the independence of national competition authorities, transparency in State aid evaluations, and vigilance against tax avoidance-linked distortions, while calling for flexibility to support sectors impacted by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.",

It emphasized the urgent need to combat tax fraud, evasion, and harmful tax practices distorting the single market, particularly impacting SMEs, which constitute 99% of EU businesses and face compliance costs 15 times higher than large firms. The resolution welcomed the Commission’s Action Plan for fair taxation, stressing modernization of VAT systems through real-time digital reporting, e-invoicing, and expanding the One-Stop Shop (OSS) to reduce administrative burdens. It called for harmonized tax rules across Member States to address fragmentation, ensure fair competition, and align with OECD/G20 agreements, including the 15% global minimum effective tax rate for multinationals under Pillar Two. The Parliament urged swift adoption of proposals like the Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (BEFIT) to create a unified corporate tax rulebook, alongside reforms to address tax residency ambiguities arising from teleworking and digitalization. It highlighted the Fiscalis program (€269 million budget) and Eurofisc 2.0 as critical tools to enhance cross-border tax cooperation, combat fraud, and improve data quality. Additionally, the resolution stressed balancing tax burdens to avoid shifting from capital to labor, supporting green transition through VAT reforms, and addressing distortions from preferential tax regimes for wealthy individuals and digital nomads.",

Key measures include exempting corporate bonds with \"make-whole clauses\" from product governance rules, exempting professional clients and eligible counterparties from mandatory cost disclosures (except for investment advice and portfolio management), and allowing professional clients to opt out of service reports and cost-benefit analyses for switching financial instruments. Retail clients retain the right to receive information on paper. Position limits on commodity derivatives were revised to exclude nascent markets and apply only to critical/significant derivatives (e.g., energy derivatives with 300,000 lots open interest over one year) and agricultural commodities for human consumption. A hedging exemption was introduced for financial entities within predominantly commercial groups, and market makers providing liquidity were exempted from position limits. Securitized derivatives were excluded from position limits. Electronic formats became the default for information delivery, with ESMA mandated to develop regulatory standards for qualitative ancillary activity exemptions and position management controls. The Commission must review the ancillary activity exemption’s impact on EU Emissions Trading System by December 2021 and propose adjustments if needed. Additional provisions include 10% depreciation thresholds for portfolio loss reporting and a 2021 review of MiFID II and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 to address broader market structure issues.",
