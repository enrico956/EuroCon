The resolution called for updating emission reduction targets to align with a 40% domestic GHG reduction by 2030 and a 60% reduction by 2050, advocating for decarbonization strategies, electrification of transport, and advanced biofuels from waste. It urged increased funding for the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) to address underinvestment, prioritize sustainable projects, and mobilize private finance. The Parliament emphasized optimizing multimodal transport systems, internalizing external costs through EU-wide methodologies, and promoting intelligent transport technologies. It proposed doubling urban public transport use by 2030, supported by Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) and EU funding, while addressing road safety (noting 90% of fatalities occur on urban/rural roads) and passenger rights. Additional measures included shifting 50% of dangerous goods transport to rail and waterways by 2030, fostering cycling networks, regulating shared mobility services fairly, and ensuring gender equality and quality jobs in the sector. The resolution also stressed digitalization, harmonized administrative procedures, and global leadership in sustainable transport standards, aligning with COP21 climate goals to limit global warming below 2°C.",

Key measures included adopting a safe system approach with harmonized key performance indicators (KPIs) for infrastructure, vehicle safety, and road user behavior, urging EU funding for road safety through programs like the Connecting Europe Facility and national road safety funds. The resolution emphasized upgrading infrastructure through risk mapping, safer urban design (e.g., 30 km/h zones), and integrating cycling/walking infrastructure into TEN-T networks. Vehicle safety reforms highlighted mandatory advanced driver-assistance systems (e.g., intelligent speed assistance, emergency lane-keeping) under the General Safety Regulation, projected to save 7,300 lives by 2030, and called for anti-lock braking systems and eCall mandates for motorcycles. It advocated stricter enforcement of cross-border traffic offenses, harmonized blood alcohol limits (zero tolerance for drugs), and updated driving license standards with graduated licensing and fatigue prevention measures. Additional priorities included addressing risks from automated vehicles, improving post-crash response, combating odometer fraud, and promoting road safety education. The resolution stressed synergies with sustainability goals, urging modal shifts to public transport and active mobility, while calling for EU-wide data frameworks, corporate accountability in supply chains, and a potential European road transport agency to oversee implementation.",
