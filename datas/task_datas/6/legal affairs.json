It emphasized the need for mandatory financial security (e.g., insurance) for operators, harmonized liability thresholds, and a potential EU-wide fund to address insolvency or large-scale incidents. The Parliament urged the Commission to clarify key concepts, establish a public EU database for ELD cases, and strengthen enforcement through standardized inspections, criminal sanctions, and alignment with the Aarhus Convention’s access to justice principles. It also recommended removing \"permit defence\" exemptions, promoting the polluter-pays principle, and requiring biennial Member State reports on ELD application.

The resolution urged all Member States to ratify the Hague Convention by the end of 2017 and called for a proposed EU regulation by 31 March 2018 to ensure automatic recognition and enforcement of protection measures—such as guardianship or mandates in anticipation of incapacity—across borders, while allowing limited public order exceptions. It advocated for standardized EU forms to streamline information sharing, national registers to track protection measures and mandates, and mechanisms for cross-border cooperation, including central authorities to facilitate communication. The resolution emphasized self-determination for vulnerable adults, non-discrimination, and tailored protections that respect individual capacities, urging Member States to adopt laws enabling advance directives and to eliminate financial barriers to accessing legal safeguards. It also stressed the need for public awareness campaigns on national laws and EU-wide coordination to share costs and responsibilities for protection measures, ensuring compliance with fundamental rights, data privacy, and subsidiarity principles.",
