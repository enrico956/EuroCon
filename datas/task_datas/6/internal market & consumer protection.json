It emphasized the need for balanced regulation to avoid overburdening SMEs and local entities while addressing gaps in consumer protection, social rights, and environmental standards. The resolution stressed the single market’s critical role in achieving the EU 2020 Strategy’s goals of sustainable growth, job creation, and a competitive social market economy, particularly through innovation, green technologies (e.g., mandatory EU-wide energy efficiency standards), and digital transformation, including e-commerce and ICT adoption. It called for stronger enforcement of existing rules, improved transposition by Member States, and enhanced tools like SOLVIT and the Internal Market Scoreboard to address delays and fragmentation. The Parliament advocated prioritizing consumer rights (e.g., product safety, redress mechanisms) and SME support through reduced bureaucracy, better access to finance, and linguistic assistance. Key proposals included a \"Single Market Act\" by May 2011 to consolidate reforms, a collective redress system, and a \"Citizens’ Charter\" to strengthen cross-border rights. The resolution also highlighted the need for global alignment of product standards, stricter market surveillance (e.g., Regulation 765/2008), and integration of social and environmental safeguards into trade policies to protect the EU’s model globally.",

It emphasized Directive 2011/7/EU’s role in setting payment terms (30 days for public authorities, 60 days for businesses), statutory interest (≥8% above ECB rates), and minimum €40 compensation for recovery costs, but noted inadequate enforcement, with 60% of businesses still paid late in B2B transactions and 95% of SMEs experiencing delayed payments. The resolution urged stricter national enforcement, including shorter payment terms (ideally 30 days), mandatory transparency on payment behavior, and administrative sanctions for non-compliance. It highlighted the economic cost of late payments, estimating €158 million daily savings and 6.5 million additional jobs if delays were reduced. Recommendations included promoting mediation services, SME training in credit management, leveraging digital payment technologies, and aligning public procurement rules with prompt payment principles. The Parliament also called for EU-wide guidelines to clarify ambiguous terms in the Directive, stronger synergies between late payment rules and sector-specific initiatives (e.g., food supply chains), and Commission action against non-compliant Member States, including ongoing infringement procedures against Greece, Slovakia, Spain, and Italy.",

The resolution urged timely implementation of public procurement rules, e-procurement, and a fraud-proof VAT system, alongside measures to combat protectionism and discriminatory practices. It stressed governance improvements through tools like the Single Market Scoreboard, better regulation principles, and enhanced market surveillance to remove non-compliant products. Social fairness, consumer protection, and inclusive growth were highlighted, alongside calls for modernizing public administrations, promoting digital services, and leveraging the Investment Plan for Europe to deepen market integration while ensuring regulatory predictability and a level playing field.

The sector, vital to the EU economy, employs 47 million people, contributes 7% of EU GDP (€1.05 billion market value), and faces crises in dairy, meat, and produce sectors due to unsustainable practices like selling below production costs. Despite voluntary initiatives like the Supply Chain Initiative (SCI), which lacks enforcement, anonymity, and farmer participation, UTPs persist, causing reduced investment, innovation, and food waste while limiting consumer choice. The resolution urges binding EU legislation to prohibit UTPs, enforce fair practices, and establish independent national enforcement bodies with investigatory powers, modeled after the UK Groceries Code Adjudicator, to ensure confidential complaints and penalties. It emphasizes strengthening producer organizations (POs) for collective bargaining, enhancing transparency via price monitoring tools, and revising competition rules to address retailer-owned brands’ anti-competitive risks.

Key issues include the TSD’s chemical provisions, which allow derogations for carcinogenic, mutagenic, or reprotoxic (CMR) substances and maintain age-based distinctions for chemical limits (e.g., toys for children under 36 months), despite evidence of manufacturers circumventing these rules. The resolution calls for eliminating derogations for CMRs, aligning nitrosamine limits with stricter German standards and EN 71-12:2017 (0.5 mg/kg for nitrosamines, 1.0 mg/kg for nitrosatable substances), and removing age distinctions to apply uniform chemical limits. It highlights the fragmentation of chemical regulations across multiple EU laws (e.g., REACH, RoHS), advocating consolidation under the TSD to streamline compliance. Endocrine disruptors and combination effects of chemicals, unaddressed in the current TSD, should be incorporated, reflecting the EU Chemical Strategy for Sustainability. Market surveillance improvements are urged, citing the 2020 EU Safety Gate report where toys accounted for 27% of unsafe product notifications. The resolution supports implementing Regulation 2019/1020 to enhance enforcement, including online marketplaces, and leveraging technologies like blockchain for traceability. E-commerce challenges require aligning the Digital Services Act and revised General Product Safety Directive to hold platforms accountable for removing non-compliant toys.

The Parliament advocated for interoperable contact-tracing apps by October 2020, harmonized passenger locator forms compliant with data protection rules, and a European Health Response Mechanism (EHRM) to strengthen crisis preparedness. It highlighted the economic impact of border closures, urging refunds for canceled flights under Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, resilient supply chains for critical goods, and swift implementation of Next Generation EU recovery funds. The resolution emphasized restoring a fully functional Schengen area, avoiding prolonged internal border controls, and protecting consumer rights against scams and unsafe products.
