    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns regarding Uzbekistan’s compliance with international human rights and environmental standards, particularly citing systematic forced child labor in cotton harvesting despite government claims that such practices are limited to private farms and not state-sanctioned. It highlighted evidence from independent observers implicating state actors, including police and security forces, in coercing teachers and families to mobilize children for labor, contradicting Uzbekistan’s assertions. The resolution emphasized the need to revise government-set cotton prices and production quotas, which perpetuate resource limitations and incentivize forced labor. It linked fair trade to human rights, urging the EU to ensure Uzbek cotton exports are not underpinned by exploitative practices. Environmental degradation was also addressed, noting that inefficient irrigation and poor standards caused the Aral Sea’s volume to drastically shrink between 1990 and 2008. Parliament called on the EU to leverage the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement—which binds Uzbekistan to democratic principles, human rights, and market economy norms—to demand reforms, enforce anti-forced labor laws, promote sustainable water management, and align trade policies with ethical and environmental benchmarks.",

Key objections included the Investment Court System (ICS), which prioritizes foreign investor rights over public interest by allowing claims without exhausting domestic legal remedies, and the Regulatory Cooperation chapter, which subordinates legislation to economic necessity, risking deregulation. Environmental safeguards were deemed inadequate, citing Canada’s history of challenging EU laws (e.g., REACH, pesticides) and CETA’s failure to enshrine the Precautionary Principle, instead aligning with weaker standards like the Codex Alimentarius. The agreement’s promotion of GMO harmonization and fossil fuel imports from Canadian tar sands (undermining the EU’s Fuel Quality Directive) further threatened climate goals. Public services faced risks due to a Negative List approach with standstill and ratchet clauses, constraining future policy flexibility. Social impacts included projected long-term unemployment and inequality, as 2011 assessments indicated redistribution favoring capital owners, while labor provisions lacked enforceable ILO core standards. Agricultural liberalization risked small-scale farmers and animal welfare, with no binding animal welfare rules. Industrial policy concerns centered on prohibitions against local content requirements, hindering green transitions, and inadequate SME support, noting 1% of exporters (large firms) dominate over half of export value. Procurement rules were criticized for cementing restrictive frameworks, limiting green infrastructure investments. Legal uncertainties persisted, including compatibility with EU Treaties, unresolved CJEU opinions (e.g., pending Belgian request), and contradictory declarations, undermining democratic oversight.

Despite a decline in trade flows post-implementation, the Agreement stabilized economies amid global challenges, with EU investment stocks rising and 1,155 Colombian (328 SMEs) and 2,328 Peruvian (90% SMEs) companies beginning exports to the EU. Concerns were raised over export reliance on raw materials (70% of Colombia and Peru’s exports), urging diversification toward value-added goods. The resolution called for enhanced SME support, improved awareness of Agreement benefits, and resolution of trade irritants like certification barriers and discriminatory taxes. It stressed the need to address labor rights gaps, including low unionization, violence against activists, and informal employment (notably affecting women), while welcoming Colombia’s OECD accession and Peru’s reforms. Environmental commitments, including Paris Agreement alignment, and anti-corruption measures were underscored, alongside calls to revise the Agreement with chapters on gender, SMEs, and a dispute mechanism for sustainability violations. The resolution urged monitoring of EU agricultural exports’ impact on local markets, compliance with banana import thresholds, and technical cooperation to meet EU food safety standards.

The resolution called for reforms to address the Doha Development Agenda’s stagnation, including revising special and differential treatment (S&DT) to better reflect countries’ economic realities, advancing plurilateral agreements on environmental goods and services, and ensuring alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement. It welcomed the 2017 Trade Facilitation Agreement (ratified by two-thirds of WTO members) as a model for future deals but urged full implementation, particularly by African nations. Criticizing U.S. steel/aluminum tariffs as WTO-inconsistent and China’s non-compliance with national treatment principles, the resolution stressed the need for transparency, gender equality in trade, digital infrastructure investment, and stronger parliamentary oversight. It advocated for binding environmental and labor standards, carbon border adjustments, and safeguarding food security and access to medicines through TRIPS flexibilities, while warning against bilateral agreements undermining multilateralism. The EU was urged to lead reforms, collaborate with major trading partners, and resolve the Appellate Body crisis to restore the WTO’s dispute settlement function.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the limitations of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) in addressing modern challenges, noting that while it reduced conflict diamonds (defined as those financing rebel movements) from 15% of global trade in 2003 to under 1%, it fails to address human rights abuses, environmental crimes, and violence perpetrated by governments, private entities, or armed groups in diamond mining. The resolution emphasized the urgent need to expand the KPCS definition of conflict diamonds to include human rights violations, forced labor, sexual violence, illegal land grabs, and environmental harm, and to extend its scope beyond rough diamonds to cover cut and polished stones. It called for stronger enforcement, independent monitoring mechanisms, and digital tools like blockchain to enhance traceability, alongside funding for civil society’s role in oversight and capacity-building in conflict-affected regions. The EU was urged to lead by adopting autonomous measures to block diamonds linked to abuses, aligning with OECD due diligence guidelines and UN principles, while supporting artisanal miners through sustainable resource management under the Global Europe Instrument. The resolution also criticized attempts to silence civil society within the KPCS and stressed the need for ethical consumer assurance to stabilize demand and protect legitimate diamond sectors.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over the crisis facing the WTO, including the non-operational Appellate Body since December 2019, threatening dispute resolution and multilateral trade governance. It stressed the urgency of substantive reforms to modernize the WTO, emphasizing outcomes at the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) in 2021, such as concluding an agreement to prohibit harmful fisheries subsidies contributing to overfishing and overcapacity, particularly targeting illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, given over 39 million people depend on fisheries. The resolution called for a pandemic response package, including tariff elimination on medical goods, transparency on trade measures, and addressing TRIPS flexibilities to enhance vaccine access, alongside establishing a WTO Committee on Trade and Health. It urged progress on agriculture, including transparency, public stockholding solutions, and adapting rules to address trade distortions. The Parliament highlighted the need to restore a two-tier dispute settlement system by MC13, reform special and differential treatment to reflect economic realities, and advance plurilateral agreements on e-commerce, digital trade, and environmental goods, including making the e-transmissions moratorium permanent. Climate action integration through trade policy alignment with the Paris Agreement and SDGs was emphasized, alongside gender equality via the 2017 Buenos Aires Declaration on Women and Trade. The resolution also supported MSMEs, labor rights, forced labor prohibitions, and transparency improvements, while urging expanded WTO membership and ratification of customs agreements to reduce bureaucracy.",
