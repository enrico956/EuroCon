It emphasized the need for sustainable reconstruction, improved disaster prevention, and climate adaptation measures, urging Member States to implement the EU Floods Directive, integrate flood-risk maps into territorial planning, and adopt cross-border strategies. The resolution called for revising land use policies, enhancing drainage systems, and increasing investments in flood-control infrastructure to mitigate future risks. It criticized the Council for blocking the 2005 proposal to reform the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF), stressing the urgency of reactivating this regulation to address climate-related disasters more flexibly. The Parliament urged swift disbursement of EUSF funds and flexibility in revising 2007-2013 regional operational programs under the ERDF, ESF, and Cohesion Fund to support affected areas. It highlighted the need to tailor assistance to regional disparities, including mountain and riverside areas, and commended cross-border solidarity and rescue efforts. The resolution linked increasing disaster frequency and severity to climate change, advocating for stronger EU frameworks to enhance resilience and public health protections.",

The resolution emphasized threats to biodiversity, ecosystems, security, and sustainable development, driven by links to drug trafficking, arms smuggling, corruption, and terrorism. It called for urgent EU action, including an EU-wide plan against wildlife crime, moratoria on ivory trade, destruction of illegal ivory stockpiles, harmonized penalties for wildlife offenses (up to four years’ imprisonment for organized crime involvement), and stricter enforcement of CITES regulations. The Parliament urged the establishment of a specialized Wildlife Crime Unit within Europol, enhanced international cooperation through initiatives like the ICCWC, ASEAN-WEN, and support for demand-reduction campaigns in consumer countries. It stressed the need for EU development aid to prioritize anti-poaching efforts, capacity-building in affected regions, and collaboration with China and African nations to address trafficking routes and legal loopholes.

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns regarding animal cloning for farming, advocating for comprehensive prohibitions on the import and marketing of descendants of cloned animals, their germinal products (semen, oocytes, embryos), and food derived from clones or their descendants, citing ethical, consumer safety, and animal welfare issues. It emphasized that cloning’s high costs, low success rates, and unresolved long-term health impacts on animals and consumers justify extending the ban beyond live clones to include descendants, ensuring coherence with existing restrictions and addressing gaps in third-country imports. The resolution expanded the scope to cover all farmed animals, including fish and poultry, beyond the Commission’s initial focus on bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine, and equine species, due to emerging evidence of welfare concerns. It rejected labeling the cloning ban as “provisional,” arguing that a decade of stagnant technological progress and persistent welfare harms necessitate a permanent prohibition, while retaining a review clause for future scientific developments. Mandatory traceability requirements for imports were stressed, requiring alignment with EU standards under Regulation (EC) No 882/2004, with delegated acts to enforce certification. The Parliament endorsed using a Regulation (rather than a Directive) as the legal instrument to ensure uniform enforcement, legal certainty, and compliance with subsidiarity principles, anchored under Article 43 of the TFEU, which supports agricultural policy objectives and import controls.",

It highlighted that the EU generates 25.8 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, with only 30% collected for recycling and 6% of new plastics made from recycled materials, while 80% of marine litter is plastic, with 150,000–500,000 tonnes entering EU seas yearly. Key measures included a call to ban oxo-degradable plastics by 2020 and microplastics in cosmetics, detergents, and personal care products by 2020, alongside stricter regulations on single-use plastics. The resolution stressed achieving a 55% recycling target for plastic packaging by 2030, promoting eco-design standards, extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes, and quality standards for recycled plastics to boost market confidence. It advocated for EU-wide digital tracking of lost fishing gear to combat marine litter, supported by incentives for fishermen to retrieve waste and recycle end-of-life nets. The Parliament urged investment in R&D, including €100 million under Horizon 2020 for circular solutions, and emphasized global cooperation via UN Sustainable Development Goals and a proposed Global Plastics Protocol.

It mandated that future measures align with the Lisbon Treaty’s ordinary legislative procedure, ensuring high-level health protections informed by scientific advancements, and required member states to notify the Commission of public health concerns arising from harmonized rules, triggering prompt review. The Parliament also underscored that the Euratom Treaty’s provisions cannot be overridden by conflicting TFEU rules, preserving its role in regulating radioactive risks.",

It emphasized the need to enhance National Contact Points (NCPs) by improving their visibility, funding, and harmonization of information, particularly on reimbursement procedures, treatment costs, and complaint mechanisms, while addressing language barriers and disparities in NCP resources. The resolution highlighted the growing role of eHealth, urging Member States to accelerate digital transformation through interoperable systems like the EU-wide eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure (eHDSI) for cross-border data exchange, while ensuring GDPR compliance and safeguarding patient privacy. It called for stronger EU cooperation on rare diseases and rare cancers, advocating expanded European Reference Networks (ERNs), standardized registries, and improved access to diagnostics and treatments, alongside integrating ERNs into national health systems. The Parliament stressed the importance of addressing medicine shortages, price disparities, and mutual recognition of prescriptions, including e-prescriptions, and urged action to simplify reimbursement for telemedicine. It criticized proposed cuts to the EU health programme, demanding increased funding in the 2021-2027 MFF to tackle cross-border challenges, antimicrobial resistance, and chronic diseases, while leveraging structural funds to reduce regional health inequalities. The resolution also highlighted the need for clearer guidelines on the interaction between the directive and social security coordination, improved EHIC implementation, and post-Brexit health agreements to protect patient rights. Noting healthcare’s economic significance (10% of EU GDP, potentially rising to 12.6% by 2060), it urged Member States to eliminate discriminatory practices by insurers, ensure cost transparency for patients, and prioritize patient quality of life in policy evaluations. Finally, the Parliament welcomed the European Court of Auditors’ planned audit on the directive’s effectiveness and called for annual reporting on cross-border reimbursements and patient flows to enhance accountability and data comparability.",

Noting that TFAs are prevalent in processed foods like baked goods, snacks, and fried items (up to 40-50g per 100g of fat in some products), the resolution highlighted inadequate EU-wide regulation and labeling, with only Denmark, Austria, Latvia, and Hungary imposing legal limits (e.g., Denmark’s 2g TFAs per 100g fat, reducing cardiovascular deaths). It criticized socioeconomic disparities, as lower-income groups face higher exposure through cheaper foods. Citing WHO recommendations (TFA intake <1% of daily energy) and EFSA’s call for minimal intake, Parliament urged the EU Commission to propose a binding 2g/100g TFA limit across all foods within two years, accompanied by an impact assessment evaluating costs for SMEs and consumers. It emphasized replacing TFAs with healthier alternatives, improving public nutritional literacy, and harmonizing EU measures to ensure equitable health benefits, rejecting reliance on voluntary industry actions or labeling alone due to inefficacy and consumer confusion.",
