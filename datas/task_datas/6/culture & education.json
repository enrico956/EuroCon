It stressed the need to address persistent challenges such as educational poverty, socio-economic disparities, low adult learning participation, early school leaving (targeting a reduction below 10%), and insufficient digital and basic skills. The resolution advocated for improved teacher training, better working conditions, and higher salaries to attract and retain qualified educators, while promoting innovative pedagogies and ICT integration, including digital competencies and open educational resources. It highlighted the urgency of integrating migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers through language support, recognition of qualifications, and inclusive curricula, alongside measures to counter radicalization and foster intercultural dialogue. The Parliament called for balanced investment in STEM and humanities disciplines, cautioning against overemphasis on labor-market outcomes at the expense of critical thinking, creativity, and ethical values. It endorsed the Europe 2020 target of 40% tertiary education attainment but urged quality assurance, dual education models, and validation of non-formal learning. Additional priorities included addressing brain drain, enhancing mobility programs like Erasmus+, and mainstreaming gender equality to close gaps in access and outcomes. The resolution urged Member States to leverage EU funding tools, improve policy coordination, and share best practices to achieve these goals while respecting national competencies and regional diversity.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns over Azerbaijan’s systematic destruction and erasure of Armenian cultural heritage in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, citing 1,456 Armenian monuments under Azerbaijani control post-2020 ceasefire, deliberate damage to sites like the Holy Saviour Cathedral in Shusha, and historical destruction of 89 Armenian churches, 20,000 graves, and 5,000 headstones in Nakhchivan. It condemned Azerbaijan’s state-level Armenophobia, historical revisionism, and attempts to rebrand Armenian heritage as \"Caucasian Albanian,\" violating International Court of Justice (ICJ) orders requiring protection of cultural sites, prevention of racial hatred, and safeguarding detainees. The resolution highlighted ICJ rulings from December 2021 mandating Azerbaijan to cease altering or destroying Armenian heritage, restore affected sites, and ensure access for UNESCO’s independent mission to inventory and protect cultural properties. It urged EU support for UNESCO’s efforts, including using satellite imagery via the EU Satellite Centre, and called for integrating cultural heritage protection into EU-Armenia/Azerbaijan partnerships. The Parliament stressed that safeguarding heritage is vital for reconciliation, sustainable peace, and adherence to international law, urging Azerbaijan to abandon territorial claims and engage in OSCE-mediated negotiations on Nagorno-Karabakh’s status. It emphasized the need for investigations into violations, humanitarian aid, and international cooperation to prevent further cultural erasure and foster dialogue.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cultural and creative sectors (CCS), which suffered cumulative losses of €199 billion in 2020, with music and performing arts sectors losing 75% and 90% of revenue respectively. It highlighted the CCS’s vital economic role, contributing 4-7% of EU GDP and 8.7 million jobs, while emphasizing their social value in fostering democracy, mental health, and cultural diversity. The resolution urged structural reforms, including a proposed *European Status of the Artist* to harmonize working conditions, social protections (e.g., pensions, healthcare), and tax deductions for cultural professionals, addressing precarious employment affecting 33% of self-employed workers. It called for allocating at least 2% of the Recovery and Resilience Facility to CCS recovery, integrating them into EU funding programs like InvestEU and Creative Europe, and simplifying cross-border mobility by reducing bureaucratic barriers. The Parliament stressed enforcing copyright reforms (Directive 2019/790) to ensure fair remuneration, promoting collective bargaining, and combating gender inequality, discrimination, and barriers faced by marginalized groups. It advocated for digital innovation, sustainable practices, and improved data collection to monitor CCS vulnerabilities, urging Member States to prioritize cultural spaces’ reopening, enhance vocational training, and safeguard artistic freedom against political interference.",
