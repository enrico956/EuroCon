It highlighted that such practices, including Malta’s citizenship-for-sale program lacking residency or tax obligations, risk security (e.g., money laundering), distort housing markets, and discriminate by privileging wealth over genuine ties to Europe. The resolution stressed that EU citizenship, conferring free movement, voting rights, and consular protection, must not be tradable and should reflect human dignity and responsibilities, not financial transactions. It urged Member States to align national schemes with EU values, called on the Commission to assess compliance with treaties and Schengen rules, and demanded Malta revise its program. The Parliament emphasized the need for guidelines to prevent citizenship and residency schemes from eroding EU integrity, while acknowledging national competence in citizenship matters but urging caution to avoid harmful side-effects.",

The resolution called for legislative reforms, urging the Commission to propose measures within a year to address systemic issues, such as standardizing the definition of \"judicial authority,\" mandating proportionality assessments for EAW issuance (considering offense severity, trial readiness, and human rights impacts), and establishing consultation procedures between Member States to resolve execution concerns. It stressed the necessity of mandatory refusal grounds for EAWs incompatible with human rights obligations under the EU Charter and ECHR, alongside enhanced legal remedies for individuals. The Parliament urged Member States to prioritize alternative measures to detention, improve prison conditions in line with human dignity, and ensure compensation for miscarriages of justice. It emphasized data collection on EAW use, withdrawal of non-executed warrants, and updates to EU databases like SIS II. Training for legal practitioners, judicial networks, and a centralized case-law database were recommended to foster a European judicial culture.

It condemned her murder and urged an independent international investigation, stressing the need to protect journalists and whistle-blowers. The resolution highlighted Malta’s high-risk media environment, including politicized ownership, defamation laws used to silence critics, and pressure on outlets like Pilatus Bank’s legal actions against journalists. It criticized Malta’s failure to investigate serious money laundering allegations linked to Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and flagged deficiencies in anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, citing a leaked FIAU report revealing violations at Pilatus Bank, which had expedited licensing under the Capital Requirements Directive. Concerns were raised about the politicization of institutions, including the government’s power to appoint key officials like the Police Commissioner and FIAU head, compromising judicial independence. The resolution noted Malta’s controversial Individual Investor Programme, selling EU citizenship for €650,000, with opaque beneficiary lists and alleged corruption risks tied to intermediary Nexia BT, implicated in the Panama Papers for setting up offshore entities for Maltese PEPs. It referenced 714 Panama Papers-linked Maltese companies and urged the Commission to verify Malta’s compliance with the AML and banking directives. The Parliament called for EU-wide monitoring of citizenship-by-investment schemes, safeguards against tax evasion, and renewed pressure to publish the delayed EU anti-corruption report. It reiterated demands for a permanent EU mechanism to uphold democracy, rule of law, and fundamental rights across all Member States.",

It supported the European Ombudsman’s recommendation for Frontex to establish a transparent, accessible, and independent mechanism to handle complaints, stressing that existing systems lacked provisions for direct complaints from affected individuals. The Parliament noted the legal ambiguity surrounding third-country officers in joint return operations and urged visible identification for personnel to clarify accountability. It called for standardized complaint forms in multiple languages, safeguards against misuse, and cooperation with national ombudsmen and human rights bodies to ensure follow-up on complaints against guest officers. The resolution underscored the necessity of gender-sensitive training, adequate resources for the Fundamental Rights Officer, and public reporting on complaints to enhance transparency. It also recommended exploring sanctions for Member States or officers violating rights, including suspending operations or excluding offenders. The Parliament urged integrating the complaints mechanism into the Frontex Regulation’s upcoming review and emphasized cooperation with EU agencies and third countries to uphold fundamental rights in border management activities.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised significant concerns about Citizenship by Investment (CBI) and Residency by Investment (RBI) schemes operated by certain Member States, emphasizing their ethical, legal, and economic risks, including money laundering, corruption, tax evasion, and threats to security and the rule of law. It noted that Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Malta currently operate CBI schemes, with Cyprus approving 6,779 passports between 2007–2020, half lacking proper vetting, while 12 Member States run RBI schemes with investments ranging from €60,000 to €1.25 million. Between 2011–2019, over 132,000 individuals (including family members) obtained residency or citizenship via these schemes, generating €21.4 billion in investments. The resolution criticized the commodification of EU citizenship, undermining its integrity and equality principles, and highlighted risks from weak due diligence, insufficient physical residence requirements, and reliance on intermediaries. It called for phasing out all CBI schemes, stricter regulation of RBI schemes through harmonized EU rules, mandatory background checks using EU databases, regulation of intermediaries, and a levy on investments via a proposed \"CBI & RBI Adjustment Mechanism\" to address negative externalities. The Parliament urged the Commission to advance infringement procedures against Cyprus and Malta, propose legislation to ban CBI schemes, amend anti-money laundering frameworks, and pressure third countries with visa-free EU access to abolish similar schemes. It stressed alignment with EU values in enlargement processes and demanded transparency, reporting, and economic contributions from RBI investments to prioritize job creation and growth.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised concerns about the fragmented and inconsistent EU legislative framework on legal labor migration, which primarily targets high-skilled workers through sectoral directives like the Blue Card, Seasonal Workers, and Intra-Corporate Transfer Directives, while neglecting low- and medium-skilled sectors despite labor shortages. It highlighted the critical role of migrant workers, who constitute 13% of key frontline workers in the EU, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which exacerbated vulnerabilities in access to healthcare, decent working conditions, and social protections. The resolution emphasized the need for a comprehensive, harmonized approach to legal migration to reduce irregular migration, combat human trafficking, and align with labor market demands, including through simplified procedures, enhanced intra-EU mobility, and improved rights for third-country nationals (TCNs), such as equal treatment, family reunification, and access to complaint mechanisms against exploitation. It called for the creation of an EU-wide talent pool to match skills with labor needs, mutual recognition of qualifications, and partnerships with third countries to address brain drain and promote circular migration. The Parliament urged revisions to existing directives, including the Seasonal Workers and Single Permit Directives, ratification of ILO Convention 189 on domestic workers, and the development of a future EU immigration code to unify rules across sectors and skill levels, ensuring transparency, fairness, and alignment with demographic and economic challenges posed by ageing populations and labor shortages.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised grave concerns over Poland’s systemic erosion of judicial independence and rule of law, particularly condemning the illegitimate ‘Constitutional Tribunal’ for its October 2021 ruling challenging the primacy of EU law, which undermines the EU’s legal framework and CJEU authority. It highlighted Poland’s failure to comply with CJEU rulings, including July 2021 interim measures suspending the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court, and stressed that legislative reforms targeting the judiciary violate EU values under Article 2 TEU. The resolution emphasized that 90% of Poles support EU membership and 72% back linking EU funds to rule of law adherence, reflecting public opposition to the government’s actions. It urged the Commission to launch infringement procedures, apply the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation to freeze funds, and withhold approval of Poland’s recovery plan until CJEU judgments are fully implemented. The Parliament called on the Council to activate Article 7(1) TEU over rule of law breaches and ensure EU funds bypass the government to reach beneficiaries directly. It condemned the politicization of Poland’s judiciary, expressed solidarity with judges upholding EU law despite risks, and warned that the Constitutional Tribunal’s illegitimate status jeopardizes citizens’ rights and EU legal cohesion. The resolution stressed these measures aim to restore rule of law, not punish Polish citizens, and safeguard EU budgetary integrity and democratic principles.",
