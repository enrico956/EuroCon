It highlighted the Lisbon Treaty’s framework, including the High Representative/Vice-President (HR/VP) and European External Action Service (EEAS), to unify external action but noted persistent gaps in coordination between EU institutions and Member States, particularly in development, trade, energy, and migration. The resolution welcomed the 2013 Joint Communication on the EU’s comprehensive approach, stressing its focus on conflict cycles (prevention, crisis response, recovery) and the security-development nexus, while cautioning against subordinating poverty eradication and humanitarian principles (neutrality, impartiality, independence) to foreign policy objectives. It called for enhanced early warning systems, gender mainstreaming in external actions, and an EU strategy for fragile states integrating OECD-DAC principles and the 2011 Busan \"New Deal.\" Climate diplomacy was underscored, urging the EEAS to leverage the 2015 Paris UN climate conference. The resolution criticized inadequate implementation of regional strategies, citing the Sahel’s 2011 strategy as a failure until Mali’s crisis, and demanded lessons-learned analyses. It stressed joint programming, alignment of trade and foreign policies, and the use of 2014–2020 financial instruments, including the Partnership Instrument, to support conflict prevention and peace-building. Gender equality measures included increasing female leadership in delegations, combating child marriage, and addressing gender-based violence in conflicts. The EU was urged to strengthen its UN role, pursue a unified UN Security Council seat, and ensure humanitarian aid remains distinct from political agendas. Finally, it emphasized coherence between internal policies and external goals, particularly in migration and climate, while safeguarding democratic oversight of external financing.",

The Kurdish issue required political dialogue, cultural rights, and socio-economic inclusion, while Turkey was pressed to normalize relations with Armenia and resolve Cyprus disputes by withdrawing forces, transferring Famagusta to the UN, and lifting vetoes on EU-NATO cooperation. The resolution called for full implementation of the EU-Turkey Customs Union, alignment with the *acquis* on labor rights, and ratification of international agreements like the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. It urged Turkey to advance foreign policy alignment with the EU, particularly regarding Iran’s nuclear program and support for democratic transitions in the Middle East, while addressing migration management and signing the EU-Turkey readmission agreement to facilitate visa liberalization.",

It stressed the importance of integrating human rights, gender equality, and international law—particularly the UN Charter and Responsibility to Protect principles—into all external actions, including CSDP missions, while calling for improved conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict reconstruction. The resolution highlighted underfunding of the CFSP budget, urging adequate financial resources for crisis responses and greater transparency in financing military operations, including scrutiny of the Athena mechanism and the new Lisbon Treaty start-up fund. It prioritized energy security through diversification, renewable energy, and projects like Nabucco and the Constanța-Trieste pipeline, while addressing climate change as a security threat. Regionally, the EU was urged to deepen engagement in the Western Balkans (supporting Kosovo’s EULEX mission), Eastern Partnership (enhancing visa liberalization and Black Sea Synergy), Middle East (reinvigorating Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts), and Asia (backing Afghanistan/Pakistan reforms and condemning Iran’s human rights abuses). The resolution advocated strengthening multilateralism via UN reform, transatlantic cooperation on global challenges, and partnerships with emerging powers, while criticizing China’s human rights record and supporting Taiwan’s inclusion in international bodies. It called for consolidating the EEAS’s structure, phasing out redundant EU Special Representatives, and ensuring gender balance in appointments. Lastly, it emphasized Africa’s security needs (extending EUNAVFOR Atalanta until 2010) and Latin American partnerships via trade agreements, while urging denunciation of the WEU Treaty to align with Lisbon’s framework.",

It highlighted Europe’s disproportionate reliance on the U.S., noting that 75% of NATO defense spending comes from the U.S., while EU states collectively spend €200 billion annually—a third of the U.S. budget—but suffer inefficiencies due to fragmented planning, duplication, and underinvestment in critical areas like strategic transport, cyber defense, and R&D (with only 1% of defense budgets allocated to research and technology). The resolution urged enhanced EU cooperation through pooled capabilities (e.g., air transport fleets, shared aircraft carriers), harmonized defense planning via the European Defence Agency (EDA), and permanent structured cooperation under the Lisbon Treaty to boost strategic autonomy. It called for reforms to establish a single European defense equipment market, enforce transparency in procurement (citing Directives 2009/43/EC and 2009/81/EC), and eliminate barriers like \"juste retour\" practices. The Parliament stressed the need to increase collaborative R&D, align civilian and military research (notably via Horizon 2020), and secure EU funding for initiatives like the European Security and Defence College and satellite capabilities (e.g., GMES). It warned that failure to address fragmentation and underfunding would perpetuate dependency on external actors, as seen in the Libya intervention, and undermine Europe’s global security role.",

    "resolution": "The European Parliament raised grave concerns over the targeted killings of polio vaccination workers and security personnel in Pakistan, particularly in 2012-2013, which led to the suspension of immunization campaigns by WHO, UNICEF, and local authorities. Pakistan, one of three polio-endemic countries, reported 198 cases in 2011 and launched a national emergency vaccination campaign targeting 33 million children, supported by international partners. Attacks, often linked to Taliban and extremist groups opposing vaccination as a \"foreign agenda,\" disproportionately affected female health workers and hindered global eradication efforts. The resolution condemned these attacks, urging Pakistan to prosecute perpetrators, enhance security for aid workers, and address misinformation fueling distrust in vaccines. It praised the courage of health workers, notably women, and stressed the need for increased health funding (below 0.3% of the budget) and public awareness campaigns. The EU called for safeguarding humanitarian neutrality globally and expressed readiness to support Pakistan’s democratic processes, including elections, while highlighting concerns over threats to women’s rights and civil society. International cooperation, including EU support for Pakistan’s Lady Health Worker Programme, was emphasized to strengthen healthcare access, particularly in rural and conflict-affected regions.",

The Parliament urged Nigeria to uphold human rights, end the death penalty (noting 56 death sentences in 2012 and 1,000 on death row), and comply with international law, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It called for independent investigations into abuses, regional cooperation against terrorism and piracy, and addressing root causes like economic inequality, resource disputes, and climate change.

It emphasized the SPA’s role in strengthening shared commitments to multilateralism, human rights, democracy, and a rules-based international order, while addressing global challenges such as terrorism, cyberthreats, and migration. The resolution highlighted Japan’s security reforms, including its \"Proactive Contribution to Peace\" policy and NATO partnerships, and urged deeper EU-Japan collaboration on regional stability, particularly in addressing tensions in the Korean Peninsula, East and South China Seas, and countering Chinese and Russian influence. It welcomed Japan’s ratification of the revised Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and urged joint efforts on sustainable development, including poverty reduction, climate change mitigation under the Paris Agreement, and sustainable energy transitions. Concerns were raised over Japan’s non-ratification of two ILO core conventions (Discrimination and Forced Labour Abolition), its use of capital punishment, and whaling practices, calling for dialogue on abolition and adherence to international conservation standards. The resolution also stressed the need to boost educational exchanges, such as Erasmus+, enhance ASEAN integration, and align Japan’s Indo-Pacific strategy with EU connectivity initiatives. It encouraged cooperation on ending animal testing in cosmetics, sustainable forestry, and biodiversity protection, while urging swift ratification and implementation of the agreements by EU Member States and Japan.",

It emphasized strict adherence to the legally binding Common Position 2008/944/CFSP, which outlines eight criteria for arms exports, including preventing internal repression and preserving regional stability, but criticized inconsistent application by member states, lax enforcement, and the absence of penalties for violations. The resolution called for enhanced transparency, including standardized reporting of export licenses and actual deliveries, and urged stricter controls on dual-use technologies, arms brokering, and diversion risks. It welcomed the UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) but highlighted gaps in enforcement and universal compliance. The Parliament advocated for establishing an independent European Arms Control Authority (EACA) to assess export licenses, align criteria with the ATT, and address loopholes in third-country production. It also stressed the need to prevent arms transfers to conflict zones like Ukraine, Syria, and Yemen, and highlighted the humanitarian consequences of illicit arms flows, including approximately 500,000 annual deaths from armed violence. The resolution urged coherence between EU defense exports and human rights priorities, stricter monitoring of end-users, and alignment of development policies to reduce arms-driven instability in vulnerable regions.",

The resolution called for leveraging Lisbon Treaty provisions (Articles 44 and 46) to enable faster, more flexible missions through permanent structured cooperation (PESCO) and group-led tasks. It criticized underfunding of civilian CSDP missions, noting a €22 million payment delay in 2014 and identifying €16 million in potential savings, while urging streamlined financial rules, a Shared Services Centre, and an upgraded CSDP Warehouse to improve mission efficiency. Military operations were noted to rely heavily on the Athena mechanism, covering only 10-15% of costs, with calls to expand common costs (e.g., strategic deployment of battlegroups) and establish a start-up fund under Article 41(3) TEU for rapid financing. The resolution stressed coherence between CSDP and other EU policies (e.g., defense industry, research) and advocated synergies in logistics, transport, and security. It urged transparency, democratic scrutiny, and accountability, opposing the use of the EU budget for military operations (per Article 41(2) TEU) and prioritizing civilian conflict resolution. Additional measures included reforming procurement rules, enhancing the European Defence Agency’s role, fostering tax incentives for defense cooperation, and ensuring strict civilian-military mission distinctions.

It highlighted his brutal flogging in January 2015, which caused severe injuries, and demanded his immediate release, alongside his lawyer Waleed Abu al-Khair, imprisoned for 15 years for human rights advocacy. The resolution condemned Saudi Arabia’s use of corporal punishment, including flogging and public beheadings—over 87 executions in 2014 and 21 by early 2015—as violations of international law, including the UN Convention against Torture. It criticized systemic repression of dissent, including censorship of online activism, blocking of websites, and misuse of counter-terrorism laws to criminalize free expression. The Parliament noted Saudi Arabia’s contradictory role as a UN Human Rights Council member and its promotion of extremist ideologies akin to groups like ISIS, while urging judicial reforms, abolition of the Specialised Criminal Court used to persecute activists, and adherence to international human rights standards. It called on the EU to reassess bilateral relations to prioritize human rights alongside economic and security interests, support Saudi civil society, and leverage diplomatic channels to demand accountability for abuses, including gender and religious discrimination. The resolution underscored Saudi Arabia’s failure to uphold pledges to protect human rights and urged alignment with global norms to enhance credibility in combating terrorism.",

It stressed that data transfers to third countries must ensure a level of protection \"essentially equivalent\" to EU law, as mandated by the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While welcoming improvements in the Privacy Shield over Safe Harbour—such as clearer definitions, oversight mechanisms, and mandatory compliance reviews—the resolution highlighted unresolved issues, including US bulk data collection under Presidential Policy Directive 28, which lacks strict necessity and proportionality under EU standards. It noted SMEs, representing 60% of Safe Harbour users, require legal certainty for transatlantic operations, given the economic significance of US-EU trade (USD 1.09 trillion in 2014) and cross-border data flows (50% higher than US-Asia flows). Criticisms included the insufficient independence and authority of the US Ombudsperson for handling surveillance complaints and the complexity of redress mechanisms for individuals. The Parliament urged the Commission to address deficiencies, seek clarifications on US legal assurances, fully implement recommendations from the Article 29 Working Party, and conduct periodic reviews of the Privacy Shield’s adequacy, particularly after the GDPR’s full application. It called for continued dialogue to strengthen data privacy, trade, and security frameworks while balancing fundamental rights and law enforcement needs.",

Enforcement mechanisms were deemed insufficient, with a burdensome five-step redress process for individuals and weak penalties for non-compliance, such as mere removal from the Privacy Shield list. The resolution criticized US government surveillance practices, noting that bulk data collection under Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28) and retention for up to five years violated EU necessity and proportionality standards, as affirmed in the Schrems judgment. It also found the ombudsperson role inadequate due to lack of independence and inability to confirm remedies or surveillance targeting. The Parliament warned that PPD-28’s non-legislative status created legal uncertainty, as it could be revoked unilaterally, and noted ongoing US legislative changes, like Rule 41 amendments, further eroding privacy. While acknowledging improvements over Safe Harbour, the resolution concluded the Privacy Shield failed to address core issues, risking legal challenges and market distortions favoring US companies.

It condemned endangering children and families, stressing the need to prioritize the best interests of minors under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and urged Spain and Morocco to cooperate on safe, lawful repatriation of children to families, leveraging existing bilateral agreements like the 2007 Spain-Morocco accord on unaccompanied minors. The resolution reaffirmed solidarity with Spain, emphasizing Ceuta’s status as an EU external border and commending Spain’s humanitarian response, while calling for emergency EU funding to support unaccompanied minors. It rejected actions undermining EU territorial integrity and urged Morocco to uphold migration cooperation commitments, including facilitating the return of 13,000 stranded Moroccan seasonal workers. The Parliament stressed the importance of resolving EU-Morocco tensions through dialogue, advancing a balanced partnership under the 2000 Association Agreement and the EU’s 2021 Mediterranean Agenda, and finalizing a long-pending EU-Morocco readmission agreement. It reiterated support for UN-led efforts to resolve the Western Sahara conflict and emphasized addressing root causes of migration through economic development and education in the region.",

Specific laws like Decrees 349 and 370 were criticized for stifling artistic and online freedoms, while the Penal Code’s \"state of danger\" provisions were highlighted for imprisoning over 8,000 individuals without charges and subjecting 2,500 to forced labor. The resolution denounced Cuba’s failure to uphold commitments under the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement (PDCA), noting no progress on human rights since its 2017 provisional application. It condemned the exploitation of medical workers in overseas missions, deemed modern slavery by UN experts, with 622 testimonies detailing inhumane conditions. The Parliament demanded immediate release of all political prisoners, including San Isidro Movement members like Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara and Maykel Castillo Pérez, and urged legal reforms to align with international human rights standards, including ILO Conventions 29 and 105. It called for repealing repressive laws, ensuring judicial independence, and inclusive dialogue with civil society. The EU was urged to enforce PDCA human rights clauses, suspend cooperation if violations persist, and ensure Cuban civil society’s inclusion in dialogues. The resolution also criticized the Cuban government for barring EU Parliament visits and harassing Sakharov Prize laureates, while demanding accountability for labor rights abuses and systemic repression.",

The resolution demanded full implementation of the Minsk Agreements, de-escalation, and withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine’s territories. It strongly condemned the politically motivated imprisonment, torture, and life-threatening treatment of Alexei Navalny, urging his immediate release, accountability for his poisoning, and sanctions against those responsible. The Parliament highlighted systemic human rights abuses in Russia, including over 15,000 detentions of protesters since January 2021, and denounced the designation of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation as “extremist.” It expressed solidarity with the Czech Republic following revelations of Russian GRU involvement in a 2014 ammunition depot explosion that killed two citizens, endorsing coordinated diplomatic responses. The resolution called for halting Nord Stream 2, reducing EU energy dependence on Russia, and imposing severe sanctions—including SWIFT exclusion and energy import bans—in case of further aggression. It urged enhanced EU-Ukraine security cooperation, support for defensive arms supplies, and adoption of an EU anti-corruption sanctions regime targeting illicit Russian wealth. The Parliament emphasized unity among Member States, cooperation with NATO and the US, and a new EU strategy for Russia prioritizing civil society engagement, human rights, and accountability for violations of international law.",

It highlighted the regime’s responsibility for 88% of civilian deaths, 99% of torture-related fatalities, and the forced disappearance of 150,000 people, alongside Russia’s role in bombing civilian infrastructure, killing 6,900 civilians, including 2,000 children. The resolution denounced Turkey’s illegal occupation of northern Syria, ethnic cleansing of Kurds, and use of Syrian mercenaries in conflicts like Nagorno-Karabakh, while urging the withdrawal of foreign forces, including Iranian and Russian proxies. It emphasized the humanitarian crisis, with 13 million Syrians needing aid, 6.8 million internally displaced, and 90% living in poverty, stressing the urgent need to renew UNSC-authorized cross-border aid via Bab al-Hawa and other crossings. The Parliament called for accountability through universal jurisdiction, supporting the International Criminal Court, and prosecuting war criminals via mechanisms like the Franco-German Joint Investigative Team and the UN’s IIIM. It urged maintaining EU sanctions on the regime and its allies, opposed normalization until credible political progress, and demanded increased humanitarian funding, noting the EU’s €20 billion contribution since 2011. The resolution also condemned attacks on healthcare, the dire conditions in Al-Hol camp (hosting 64,000, including 9,000 ISIL-linked detainees), and the regime’s destruction of cultural heritage, while advocating for safe refugee returns and protecting children’s rights, including 2.8 million out of school.",

It condemned Russia’s aggression in eastern Ukraine, illegal annexation of Crimea, and destabilizing actions in the Sea of Azov, urging prolonged EU sanctions until territorial integrity is restored and proposing an EU special envoy for the conflict. The resolution stressed the need for urgent deoligarchization, judicial reforms—including establishing an independent High Anti-Corruption Court—and enhanced anti-corruption measures, citing concerns over political interference in the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU). It highlighted the importance of electoral reforms, minority rights, media freedom, and civil society protection, condemning attacks on activists like Kateryna Handziuk. Economically, it noted increased EU-Ukraine trade and a €200 million SME support fund but expressed alarm over rising poverty, wealth inequality, and the need for investment. Environmental and energy cooperation were urged, including opposition to Nord Stream 2 and sustainable resource management. The Parliament called for improved AA/DCFTA implementation through better institutional coordination, regulatory alignment, and annual EU monitoring reports, while advocating for Ukraine’s European perspective under Article 49 TEU and enhanced Eastern Partnership Plus cooperation. It also emphasized addressing humanitarian crises, supporting IDPs, and ensuring social welfare amid ongoing conflict.",

The resolution stressed the necessity of reducing energy dependence on authoritarian regimes, enhancing cybersecurity and defense cooperation through initiatives like the European Defence Agency and NATO collaboration, and allocating 2% of GDP and 20% of defense budgets to critical equipment. It highlighted concerns over Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, hybrid warfare, and veto misuse in the UN Security Council, while advocating for conditional engagement. The Parliament urged reforms to enable qualified majority voting for CFSP decisions, criticized underfunding (noting CFSP’s 0.2% share of the 2016 EU budget and a €55.6 million deficit in 2017), and called for transparent budget lines for major missions. Additional priorities included addressing climate change’s security impacts, promoting legal migration, countering disinformation, expanding cultural diplomacy via programs like Erasmus+, and strengthening partnerships with the US, Latin America, and Asia to uphold multilateralism and a rules-based global order.",

It condemned the disproportionate post-coup measures, including the imprisonment of opposition politicians like HDP leaders and Kurdish mayors, and highlighted Turkey’s decline to 155th in press freedom rankings. The resolution criticized the April 2017 constitutional referendum, conducted under emergency conditions with alleged irregularities, for consolidating executive power and undermining checks and balances, as noted by the Venice Commission. It reiterated calls to suspend EU accession negotiations if constitutional reforms proceed unchanged, citing non-compliance with Copenhagen criteria, and urged Turkey to reverse measures violating judicial independence, including the dismissal of 4,000 judges. The Parliament condemned Turkey’s threats to reintroduce the death penalty, which would end accession talks, and urged compliance with ECHR rulings. It expressed alarm over violence in southeast Turkey, where 2,000 were killed and 500,000 displaced, and called for renewed peace efforts on the Kurdish issue. The resolution acknowledged Turkey’s hosting of 3 million refugees and stressed the need for sustained EU support under the 2016 migration deal while urging Turkey to grant refugees work permits and education access. It condemned Turkey’s violations of Greek and Cypriot sovereignty, including airspace incursions and gas exploration in Cyprus’ EEZ, and called for troop withdrawals from Cyprus and adherence to UN resolutions. The Parliament emphasized the importance of EU-Turkey cooperation on counter-terrorism, trade, and energy but insisted on conditionality tied to human rights, urging reforms to anti-terror laws for visa liberalization and modernization of the Customs Union with human rights clauses. Finally, it called for accountability for human rights abuses, protection of minorities, cultural heritage, and religious freedoms, and urged Turkey to normalize relations with Armenia and cease inflammatory rhetoric against EU members.",

The resolution urged constitutional, electoral, and judicial reforms to ensure non-discrimination, rule of law, and functional governance, stressing the need to address OSCE/ODIHR recommendations and operationalize the Stabilisation and Association Parliamentary Committee (SAPC), stalled for three years due to procedural disputes. It highlighted systemic corruption, weak anti-corruption frameworks, and politicization of public administration, calling for improved judicial independence, prosecution of high-profile cases, and alignment with GRECO recommendations. Human rights concerns included gender inequality, inadequate protections for minorities (notably Roma facing exclusion in education, employment, and housing), and delays in adopting a national human rights strategy. The Parliament emphasized the need for transitional justice, including a law compensating wartime sexual violence victims, resolving over 540,000 landmine-affected areas (2.2% of territory), and addressing 7,000 missing persons cases. Economic challenges included high youth unemployment, migration pressures (with EU allocating €6 million for migration management), and slow environmental reforms, particularly transboundary pollution and non-compliance with energy and climate standards.

It urged the creation of a permanent EU headquarters for CSDP missions, prioritized regional engagement in conflicts affecting EU security (e.g., Sahel, Middle East), and supported capacity-building initiatives, including amendments to Regulation (EU) No 230/2014 to equip military partners in exceptional circumstances. Collaboration with NATO was underscored as essential, focusing on complementarity in deterrence, cyber defense, and hybrid threats, while maintaining EU strategic independence. The resolution advocated for a unified European defense industry, reduced market fragmentation, joint procurement, and increased EU-funded defense research, including a future European Defence Research Programme. It highlighted public support (two-thirds of citizens per Eurobarometer 85.1) for greater EU security engagement and stressed the urgency of countering radicalization, enhancing judicial cooperation against terrorism, and safeguarding democratic institutions through Article 222 TFEU’s solidarity clause. The Parliament also called for strict adherence to international law, UN Charter principles, and civilian-led conflict resolution, while rejecting military funding from the EU budget and advocating separation from NATO structures.",

It highlighted the need to protect vulnerable groups, including women (48% of 258 million global migrants) and children, advocating an end to child detention, access to education, and family reunification. The resolution stressed the urgency of tackling statelessness, forced displacement (65 million people, including 12 million Syrians), and migrant deaths (14,500 in the Central Mediterranean since 2014). It called for safe, legal migration pathways, resettlement commitments (urging EU states to meet 20% of global resettlement needs for 1.2 million refugees), and adherence to international frameworks like the 1951 Refugee Convention and ILO standards. The Parliament urged EU unity in negotiations, condemning the U.S. withdrawal, and emphasized data-driven policies, SDG alignment (notably poverty reduction and gender equality), and financial support for host countries (85% of refugees reside in developing regions). It underscored migrants’ economic contributions (USD 596 billion in remittances in 2017) and called for minimizing transfer costs, while rejecting criminalization of humanitarian aid and advocating dignified returns. The resolution demanded robust monitoring mechanisms for Compact implementation, inclusive stakeholder engagement, and EU leadership in ensuring non-binding agreements translate into actionable, rights-based outcomes.",
