The resolution highlighted a EUR 3,955 million decrease in TOR and a EUR 384 million drop in VAT-based revenue, offset by EUR 1,229 million from fines, leading to a EUR 3,110 million increase in GNI-based contributions from Member States (net increase of EUR 2,736 million). It stressed the need to avoid underfunding payment needs identified in subsequent amending budgets, noting that cumulative budgets for 2007-2013 fell EUR 60 billion below the Multiannual Financial Framework ceiling, while a EUR 12 billion surplus had been returned to Member States via reduced GNI contributions. The resolution approved the Council’s unchanged position on the draft budget, emphasizing the urgency of preventing cash shortages in 2013. It also addressed the creation of budgetary structures for EU trust funds under Article 187 of the Financial Regulation and demanded transparency from the Commission on the timing and fiscal impact of increased national contributions.",

It highlighted insufficient funding for critical areas like research (FP7, +13.8%), innovation (CIP, +4.4%), lifelong learning (+2.6%), and transport networks (TENs, +16.8%), stressing their role in economic recovery. The resolution called for urgent revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) to address inflexibility and underfunding, particularly for cohesion policies, space programs like GMES, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), where payment appropriations were deemed insufficient despite their inclusion for the first time. Agricultural priorities included increased funding for decoupled aid (+9.7%), school fruit schemes (€90 million, +50%), and dairy sector support, while expressing concern over volatile markets and the need for permanent mechanisms to address price instability. External action saw demands for additional climate finance (€65 million in 2011) without diverting development funds, increased humanitarian aid, and strengthened Eastern Partnership funding. The Parliament criticized underfunding of gender equality programs, including reduced commitments for the DAPHNE initiative combating violence, and stressed the need for gender budgeting across EU policies. Administrative concerns included a 13% cut to EPSO’s budget, risks to recruitment quality, and insufficient transparency in IT projects like SIS II. The resolution also emphasized the importance of pilot projects, cohesion policy funding to support economic recovery, and adequate resources for the European External Action Service (EEAS) and CFSP (€327.4 million). It called for synergies between EU and national budgets to maximize impact, condemned speculative cuts amid fiscal constraints, and urged coherence in financing new initiatives like the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps and the European Year of Volunteering (€8 million).",

The resolution emphasized strict budgetary discipline, limiting ordinary expenditure growth to 1.4% while addressing statutory obligations like staff salaries (60% of the budget) and reducing administrative posts by 60. It called for transparency in budget presentation, medium-term planning for security and building projects (notably the Konrad Adenauer and PHS buildings), and improved digital tools for Members, including paperless workflows and secure digital signatures. Other measures included rationalizing interpretation services, exempting political groups from staff cuts, promoting energy efficiency, and ensuring affordable healthy food in Parliament facilities. The resolution also stressed accountability for Members’ expenses, streamlined procurement practices, and evaluations of communication strategies and parliamentary assistance allowances, while maintaining commitments to multilingual accessibility and trainees’ rights.",

The resolution called for doubling the Erasmus+ budget to meet demand, boosting Horizon 2020, COSME, and SME support programs, and reversing cuts to initiatives like the Connecting Europe Facility caused by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI). Climate action was prioritized, with a demand to meet the 20% climate spending target under the 2014-2020 MFF and increase LIFE programme funding. Migration and security measures included adequate financing for the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), border agencies, and the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP), funded via new appropriations, not redeployments. The resolution highlighted cohesion policy’s role in reducing regional disparities, supported agricultural stability via the CAP, and urged gender equality measures through SME access and childcare investments. It opposed using external trust funds that bypass parliamentary scrutiny, advocated integrating them into the EU budget, and stressed the UK’s continued budget contributions through 2020 despite Brexit. Lastly, it underscored the need for fresh funding for new challenges without cutting successful programs, ensuring transparency, and aligning the budget with the Paris Agreement, UN Sustainable Development Goals, and EU 2020 strategy.",

It called for inclusive recovery measures, including boosting Erasmus+, dedicating 10% of RRF funds to education, addressing youth unemployment, and implementing gender-responsive budgeting. The Parliament emphasized expanding Schengen to Bulgaria, Romania, and Croatia, increasing Frontex funding with accountability, and upholding rule of law via the EPPO. It demanded accelerated MFF implementation, including EURI commitments (60% by 2022) and new own resources (carbon border tax, digital levy) by July 2022, while addressing delays in programme rollouts and ensuring adequate payments to avoid fiscal crises. Tourism, cultural sectors, and defense innovation were flagged for targeted support, alongside migration management and NDICI funding for external challenges. The resolution underscored strict monitoring of climate and digital targets, including 20% RRF allocations for digital transition, and robust tracking methodologies for budgetary transparency.",

It emphasized boosting flagship programs while maintaining cohesion, agriculture, and fisheries funding, and integrating the UN Sustainable Development Goals, climate action, and gender equality across all policies. The resolution demanded a reformed EU revenue system, including new own resources such as a carbon border adjustment mechanism, digital services tax, and financial transaction tax, while abolishing rebates and simplifying VAT. It insisted on a rule-of-law mechanism to protect the EU budget from systemic violations of EU values. The Parliament criticized the Council’s delays in negotiations, called for immediate trilateral talks, and urged the Commission to propose an MFF contingency plan by early 2020 to extend current funding ceilings if needed, preventing program disruptions. It welcomed the incoming Commission’s commitments, including the European Green Deal, but stressed that new initiatives must not compromise the MFF’s ambition, warning against reduced funding as a setback. Climate mainstreaming was underscored as essential, requiring transparent methodologies and Parliament’s involvement in tracking climate-related spending.
